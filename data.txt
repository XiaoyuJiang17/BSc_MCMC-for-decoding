LEFT ME NOW HE SAID WITH A SIGHCHAPTER XSOON AFTER HIS ADMISSION TO THE MASONIC BROTHERHOOD PIERRE WENT TO THEKIEV PROVINCE WHERE HE HAD THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SERFS TAKING WITHHIM FULL DIRECTIONS WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN DOWN FOR HIS OWN GUIDANCE AS TOWHAT HE SHOULD DO ON HIS ESTATESWHEN HE REACHED KIEV HE SENT FOR ALL HIS STEWARDS TO THE HEAD OFFICEAND EXPLAINED TO THEM HIS INTENTIONS AND WISHES HE TOLD THEM THAT STEPSWOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO FREE HIS SERFSAND THAT TILL THEN THEYWERE NOT TO BE OVERBURDENED WITH LABOR WOMEN WHILE NURSING THEIR BABIESWERE NOT TO BE SENT TO WORK ASSISTANCE WAS TO BE GIVEN TO THE SERFSPUNISHMENTS WERE TO BE ADMONITORY AND NOT CORPORAL AND HOSPITALSASYLUMS AND SCHOOLS WERE TO BE ESTABLISHED ON ALL THE ESTATES SOME OFTHE STEWARDS THERE WERE SEMILITERATE FOREMEN AMONG THEM LISTENED WITHALARM SUPPOSING THESE WORDS TO MEAN THAT THE YOUNG COUNT WAS DISPLEASEDWITH THEIR MANAGEMENT AND EMBEZZLEMENT OF MONEY SOME AFTER THEIR FIRSTFRIGHT WERE AMUSED BY PIERRES LISP AND THE NEW WORDS THEY HAD NOTHEARD BEFORE OTHERS SIMPLY ENJOYED HEARING HOW THE MASTER TALKED WHILETHE CLEVEREST AMONG THEM INCLUDING THE CHIEF STEWARD UNDERSTOOD FROMTHIS SPEECH HOW THEY COULD BEST HANDLE THE MASTER FOR THEIR OWN ENDSTHE CHIEF STEWARD EXPRESSED GREAT SYMPATHY WITH PIERRES INTENTIONSBUT REMARKED THAT BESIDES THESE CHANGES IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO GO INTOTHE GENERAL STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH WAS FAR FROM SATISFACTORYDESPITE COUNT BEZKHOVS ENORMOUS WEALTH SINCE HE HAD COME INTO ANINCOME WHICH WAS SAID TO AMOUNT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBLES A YEARPIERRE FELT HIMSELF FAR POORER THAN WHEN HIS FATHER HAD MADE HIMAN ALLOWANCE OF TEN THOUSAND RUBLES HE HAD A DIM PERCEPTION OF THEFOLLOWING BUDGETABOUT  WENT IN PAYMENTS ON ALL THE ESTATES TO THE LAND BANK

YEAR HE WAS OBLIGED TO BORROW BESIDES THIS THECHIEF STEWARD WROTE EVERY YEAR TELLING HIM OF FIRES AND BAD HARVESTSOR OF THE NECESSITY OF REBUILDING FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS SO THE FIRSTTASK PIERRE HAD TO FACE WAS ONE FOR WHICH HE HAD VERY LITTLE APTITUDE ORINCLINATIONPRACTICAL BUSINESSHE DISCUSSED ESTATE AFFAIRS EVERY DAY WITH HIS CHIEF STEWARD BUTHE FELT THAT THIS DID NOT FORWARD MATTERS AT ALL HE FELT THAT THESECONSULTATIONS WERE DETACHED FROM REAL AFFAIRS AND DID NOT LINK UP WITHTHEM OR MAKE THEM MOVE ON THE ONE HAND THE CHIEF STEWARD PUT THE STATEOF THINGS TO HIM IN THE VERY WORST LIGHT POINTING OUT THE NECESSITY OFPAYING OFF THE DEBTS AND UNDERTAKING NEW ACTIVITIES WITH SERF LABORTO WHICH PIERRE DID NOT AGREE ON THE OTHER HAND PIERRE DEMANDED THATSTEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO LIBERATE THE SERFS WHICH THE STEWARD MET BYSHOWING THE NECESSITY OF FIRST PAYING OFF THE LOANS FROM THE LAND BANKAND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF A SPEEDY EMANCIPATIONTHE STEWARD DID NOT SAY IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE BUT SUGGESTED SELLINGTHE FORESTS IN THE PROVINCE OF KOSTROM THE LAND LOWER DOWN THE RIVERAND THE CRIMEAN ESTATE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE ALL OF WHICHOPERATIONS ACCORDING TO HIM WERE

REASONABLENESSBEFORE PRINCE ANDREW AND FLATTERED HIM WITH THAT SUBTLE FLATTERY WHICHGOES HAND IN HAND WITH SELFASSURANCE AND CONSISTS IN A TACIT ASSUMPTIONTHAT ONES COMPANION IS THE ONLY MAN BESIDES ONESELF CAPABLE OFUNDERSTANDING THE FOLLY OF THE REST OF MANKIND AND THE REASONABLENESSAND PROFUNDITY OF ONES OWN IDEASDURING THEIR LONG CONVERSATION ON WEDNESDAY EVENING SPERNSKI MORETHAN ONCE REMARKED WE REGARD EVERYTHING THAT IS ABOVE THE COMMONLEVEL OF ROOTED CUSTOM OR WITH A SMILE BUT WE WANT THE WOLVESTO BE FED AND THE SHEEP TO BE SAFE OR THEY CANNOT UNDERSTANDTHIS AND ALL IN A WAY THAT SEEMED TO SAY WE YOU AND IUNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE AND WHO WE ARETHIS FIRST LONG CONVERSATION WITH SPERNSKI ONLY STRENGTHENED IN PRINCEANDREW THE FEELING HE HAD EXPERIENCED TOWARD HIM AT THEIR FIRST MEETINGHE SAW IN HIM A REMARKABLE CLEARTHINKING MAN OF VAST INTELLECT WHO BYHIS ENERGY AND PERSISTENCE HAD ATTAINED POWER WHICH HE WAS USING SOLELYFOR THE WELFARE OF RUSSIA IN PRINCE ANDREWS EYES SPERNSKI WAS THEMAN HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE WISHED TO BEONE WHO EXPLAINED ALL THE FACTSOF LIFE REASONABLY CONSIDERED IMPORTANT ONLY WHAT WAS RATIONAL ANDWAS CAPABLE OF APPLYING THE STANDARD OF REASON TO EVERYTHING EVERYTHINGSEEMED SO SIMPLE AND CLEAR IN SPERNSKIS EXPOSITION THAT PRINCEANDREW INVOLUNTARILY AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT EVERYTHING IF HE REPLIED ANDARGUED IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO MAINTAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE ANDNOT SUBMIT TO SPERNSKIS OPINIONS ENTIRELY EVERYTHING WAS RIGHTAND EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE ONLY ONE THING DISCONCERTED PRINCEANDREW THIS WAS SPERNSKIS COLD MIRRORLIKE LOOK WHICH DID NOTALLOW ONE TO PENETRATE TO HIS SOUL AND HIS DELICATE WHITE HANDS WHICHPRINCE ANDREW INVOLUNTARILY WATCHED AS ONE DOES WATCH THE HANDS OFTHOSE WHO POSSESS POWER THIS MIRRORLIKE GAZE AND THOSE DELICATE HANDSIRRITATED PRINCE ANDREW HE KNEW NOT WHY HE WAS UNPLEASANTLYSTRUCK TOO BY THE EXCESSIVE CONTEMPT FOR OTHERS THAT HE OBSERVED INSPERNSKI AND BY THE DIVERSITY OF LINES OF ARGUMENT HE USED TOSUPPORT HIS OPINIONS HE MADE USE OF EVERY KIND OF MENTAL DEVICE EXCEPTANALOGY AND PASSED TOO BOLDLY IT SEEMED TO PRINCE ANDREW FROM ONETO ANOTHER NOW HE WOULD TAKE UP THE POSITION OF A PRACTICAL MAN ANDCONDEMN DREAMERS NOW THAT OF A SATIRIST AND LAUGH IRONICALLY AT HISOPPONENTS NOW GROW SEVERELY LOGICAL OR SUDDENLY RISE TO THE REALM OFMETAPHYSICS THIS LAST RESOURCE WAS ONE HE VERY FREQUENTLY EMPLOYEDHE WOULD TRANSFER A QUESTION TO METAPHYSICAL HEIGHTS PASS ON TODEFINITIONS OF SPACE TIME AND THOUGHT AND HAVING DEDUCED THEREFUTATION HE NEEDED WOULD AGAIN DESCEND TO THE LEVEL OF THE ORIGINALDISCUSSIONIN GENERAL THE TRAIT OF SPERNSKIS MENTALITY WHICH STRUCK PRINCEANDREW MOST WAS HIS ABSOLUTE AND UNSHAKABLE BELIEF IN THE POWER ANDAUTHORITY OF REASON IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE THOUGHT COULD NEVER OCCURTO HIM WHICH TO PRINCE ANDREW SEEMED SO NATURAL NAMELY THAT IT ISAFTER ALL IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS ALL ONE THINKS AND THAT HE HAD NEVERFELT THE DOUBT IS NOT ALL I THINK AND BELIEVE NONSENSE ANDIT WAS JUST THIS PECULIARITY OF SPERNSKIS MIND THAT PARTICULARLYATTRACTED PRINCE ANDREWDURING THE FIRST PERIOD OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BOLKNSKI FELT APASSIONATE ADMIRATION FOR HIM SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HE HAD ONCE FELT FORBONAPARTE THE FACT THAT SPERNSKI WAS THE SON OF A VILLAGE PRIESTAND THAT STUPID PEOPLE MIGHT MEANLY DESPISE HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HISHUMBLE ORIGIN AS IN FACT MANY DID CAUSED PRINCE ANDREW TO CHERISH HISSENTIMENT FOR HIM THE MORE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY TO STRENGTHEN ITON THAT FIRST EVENING BOLKNSKI SPENT WITH HIM HAVING MENTIONED THECOMMISSION FOR THE REVISION OF THE CODE OF LAWS SPERNSKI TOLD HIMSARCASTICALLY THAT THE COMMISSION HAD EXISTED FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTYYEARS HAD COST MILLIONS AND HAD DONE NOTHING EXCEPT THAT ROSENKAMPFHAD STUCK LABELS ON THE CORRESPONDING PARAGRAPHS OF THE DIFFERENT CODESAND THAT IS ALL THE STATE HAS FOR THE MILLIONS IT HAS SPENT SAIDHE WE WANT TO GIVE THE SENATE NEW JURIDICAL POWERS BUT WE HAVE NOLAWS THAT IS WHY IT IS A SIN FOR MEN LIKE YOU PRINCE NOT TO SERVE INTHESE TIMESPRINCE ANDREW SAID THAT FOR THAT WORK AN EDUCATION IN JURISPRUDENCE WASNEEDED WHICH HE DID NOT POSSESSBUT NOBODY POSSESSES IT SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE IT IS A VICIOUSCIRCLE FROM WHICH WE MUST BREAK A WAY OUTA WEEK LATER PRINCE ANDREW WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON ARMYREGULATIONS ANDWHAT HE HAD NOT AT ALL EXPECTEDWAS CHAIRMAN OF ASECTION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE REVISION OF THE LAWS AT SPERNSKISREQUEST HE TOOK THE FIRST PART OF THE CIVIL CODE THAT WAS BEING DRAWN UPAND WITH THE AID OF THE CODE NAPOLON AND THE INSTITUTES OF JUSTINIANHE WORKED AT FORMULATING THE SECTION ON PERSONAL RIGHTSCHAPTER VIINEARLY TWO YEARS BEFORE THIS IN  PIERRE ON RETURNING TO PETERSBURGAFTER VISITING HIS ESTATES HAD INVOLUNTARILY FOUND HIMSELF IN A

FREEMASONRYIN THE SECOND CATEGORY PIERRE RECKONED HIMSELF AND OTHERS LIKE HIMSEEKING AND VACILLATING WHO HAD NOT YET FOUND IN FREEMASONRY A STRAIGHTAND COMPREHENSIBLE PATH BUT HOPED TO DO SOIN THE THIRD CATEGORY HE INCLUDED THOSE BROTHERS THE MAJORITY WHO SAWNOTHING IN FREEMASONRY BUT THE EXTERNAL FORMS AND CEREMONIES AND PRIZEDTHE STRICT PERFORMANCE OF THESE FORMS WITHOUT TROUBLING ABOUT THEIRPURPORT OR SIGNIFICANCE SUCH WERE WILLARSKI AND EVEN THE GRAND MASTEROF THE PRINCIPAL LODGEFINALLY TO THE FOURTH CATEGORY ALSO A GREAT MANY BROTHERS BELONGEDPARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD LATELY JOINED THESE ACCORDING TO PIERRESOBSERVATIONS WERE MEN WHO HAD NO BELIEF IN ANYTHING NOR DESIRE FORANYTHING BUT JOINED THE FREEMASONS MERELY TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE WEALTHYYOUNG BROTHERS WHO WERE INFLUENTIAL THROUGH THEIR CONNECTIONS OR RANKAND OF WHOM THERE WERE VERY MANY IN THE LODGEPIERRE BEGAN TO FEEL DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING FREEMASONRYAT ANY RATE AS HE SAW IT HERE SOMETIMES SEEMED TO HIM BASED MERELYON EXTERNALS HE DID NOT THINK OF DOUBTING FREEMASONRY ITSELF BUTSUSPECTED THAT RUSSIAN MASONRY HAD TAKEN A WRONG PATH AND DEVIATEDFROM ITS ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES AND SO TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR HE WENTABROAD TO BE INITIATED INTO THE HIGHER SECRETS OF THE ORDERIN THE SUMMER OF  PIERRE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG OUR FREEMASONS KNEWFROM CORRESPONDENCE WITH THOSE ABROAD THAT

CONCEALING ITA SOLEMN MEETING OF THE LODGE OF THE SECOND DEGREE WAS CONVENED ATWHICH PIERRE PROMISED TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PETERSBURG BROTHERS WHATHE HAD TO DELIVER TO THEM FROM THE HIGHEST LEADERS OF THEIR ORDER THEMEETING WAS A FULL ONE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES PIERRE ROSE AND BEGANHIS ADDRESSDEAR BROTHERS HE BEGAN BLUSHING AND STAMMERING WITH A WRITTENSPEECH IN HIS HAND IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO

THERE HAD BEEN SO STORMY AMEETING PARTIES WERE FORMED SOME ACCUSING PIERRE OF ILLUMINISM OTHERSSUPPORTING HIM AT THAT MEETING HE WAS STRUCK FOR THE FIRST TIME BYTHE ENDLESS VARIETY OF MENS MINDS WHICH PREVENTS A TRUTH FROM EVERPRESENTING ITSELF IDENTICALLY TO TWO PERSONS EVEN THOSE MEMBERSWHO SEEMED TO BE ON HIS SIDE UNDERSTOOD HIM IN THEIR OWN WAY WITHLIMITATIONS AND ALTERATIONS HE COULD NOT AGREE TO AS WHAT HE ALWAYSWANTED MOST WAS TO CONVEY HIS THOUGHT TO OTHERS JUST AS HE HIMSELFUNDERSTOOD IT      THE ILLUMINATI SOUGHT TO SUBSTITUTE REPUBLICAN FOR     MONARCHICAL INSTITUTIONSAT THE END OF THE MEETING THE GRAND MASTER WITH IRONY AND ILLWILLREPROVED BEZKHOV FOR HIS VEHEMENCE AND SAID IT WAS NOT LOVE OF VIRTUEALONE BUT ALSO A LOVE OF STRIFE THAT HAD MOVED HIM IN THE DISPUTEPIERRE DID NOT ANSWER HIM AND ASKED BRIEFLY WHETHER HIS PROPOSAL WOULDBE ACCEPTED HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD NOT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR THEUSUAL FORMALITIES HE LEFT THE LODGE AND WENT HOMECHAPTER VIIIAGAIN PIERRE WAS OVERTAKEN BY THE DEPRESSION HE SO DREADED FOR THREEDAYS AFTER THE DELIVERY OF HIS SPEECH AT THE LODGE HE LAY ON A SOFA ATHOME RECEIVING NO ONE AND GOING NOWHEREIT WAS JUST THEN THAT HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE WHO IMPLOREDHIM TO SEE HER TELLING HIM HOW GRIEVED SHE WAS ABOUT HIM AND HOW SHEWISHED TO DEVOTE HER WHOLE LIFE TO HIMAT THE END OF THE LETTER SHE INFORMED HIM THAT IN A FEW DAYS SHE WOULDRETURN TO PETERSBURG FROM ABROADFOLLOWING THIS LETTER ONE OF THE MASONIC BROTHERS WHOM PIERRE RESPECTEDLESS THAN THE OTHERS FORCED HIS WAY IN TO SEE HIM AND TURNING THECONVERSATION UPON PIERRES MATRIMONIAL AFFAIRS BY WAY OF FRATERNALADVICE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT HIS SEVERITY TO HIS WIFE WAS WRONGAND THAT HE WAS NEGLECTING ONE OF THE FIRST RULES OF FREEMASONRY BY NOTFORGIVING THE PENITENTAT THE SAME TIME HIS MOTHERINLAW PRINCE VASLIS WIFE SENT TOHIM IMPLORING HIM TO COME IF ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES TO DISCUSS A MOSTIMPORTANT MATTER PIERRE SAW THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM ANDTHAT THEY WANTED TO REUNITE HIM WITH HIS WIFE AND IN THE MOOD HE THENWAS THIS WAS NOT EVEN UNPLEASANT TO HIM NOTHING MATTERED TO HIMNOTHING IN LIFE SEEMED TO HIM OF MUCH IMPORTANCE AND UNDER THEINFLUENCE OF THE DEPRESSION THAT POSSESSED HIM HE VALUED NEITHER HISLIBERTY NOR HIS RESOLUTION TO PUNISH HIS WIFENO ONE IS RIGHT AND NO ONE IS TO BLAME SO SHE TOO IS NOT TOBLAME HE THOUGHTIF HE DID NOT AT ONCE GIVE HIS CONSENT TO A REUNION WITH HIS WIFE ITWAS ONLY BECAUSE IN HIS STATE OF DEPRESSION HE DID NOT FEEL ABLE TO TAKEANY STEP HAD HIS WIFE COME TO HIM HE WOULD NOT HAVE TURNED HER AWAYCOMPARED TO WHAT PREOCCUPIED HIM WAS IT NOT A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCEWHETHER HE LIVED WITH HIS WIFE OR NOTWITHOUT REPLYING EITHER TO HIS WIFE OR HIS MOTHERINLAW PIERRE LATEONE NIGHT PREPARED FOR A

ANDSELFPURIFICATION ONLY TO THIS AIM CAN WE ALWAYS STRIVE INDEPENDENTLYOF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT THE SAME TIME JUST THIS AIM DEMANDS THEGREATEST EFFORTS OF US AND SO LED ASTRAY BY PRIDE LOSING SIGHT OFTHIS AIM WE OCCUPY OURSELVES EITHER WITH THE MYSTERY WHICH IN OURIMPURITY WE ARE UNWORTHY TO RECEIVE OR SEEK THE REFORMATION OFTHE HUMAN RACE WHILE OURSELVES SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF BASENESS

BUONAPARTE WHO ONLY AT BALD HILLS IN THE WHOLE WORLD IT SEEMS ISNOT ACCEPTED AS A GREAT MAN STILL LESS AS EMPEROR OF FRANCE AND MYFATHER CANNOT STAND THIS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OFHIS POLITICAL VIEWS THAT MY FATHER IS RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OF GOING TOMOSCOW FOR HE FORESEES THE ENCOUNTERS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM HIS WAYOF EXPRESSING HIS VIEWS REGARDLESS OF ANYBODY ALL THE BENEFIT HE MIGHTDERIVE FROM A COURSE OF TREATMENT HE WOULD LOSE AS A RESULT OF THEDISPUTES ABOUT BUONAPARTE WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY CASE IT WILLBE DECIDED VERY SHORTLYOUR FAMILY LIFE GOES ON IN THE

TOTHIS PARTY BELONGED THE FOREIGN NOBLES WOLZOGEN WINTZINGERODE ANDOTHERS CHIEFLY GERMANSTHE SECOND PARTY WAS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE FIRST ONE EXTREME ASALWAYS HAPPENS WAS MET BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER THE MEMBERS OFTHIS PARTY WERE THOSE WHO HAD DEMANDED AN ADVANCE FROM VLNA INTO POLANDAND FREEDOM FROM ALL PREARRANGED PLANS BESIDES BEING ADVOCATES OF BOLDACTION THIS SECTION ALSO REPRESENTED NATIONALISM WHICH MADE THEM STILLMORE ONESIDED IN THE DISPUTE THEY WERE RUSSIANS BAGRATIN ERMLOVWHO WAS BEGINNING TO COME TO THE FRONT AND OTHERS AT THAT TIME AFAMOUS JOKE OF ERMLOVS WAS BEING CIRCULATED THAT AS A GREAT FAVOR HEHAD PETITIONED THE EMPEROR TO MAKE HIM A GERMAN THE MEN OF THAT PARTYREMEMBERING SUVROV SAID THAT WHAT ONE HAD TO DO WAS NOT TO REASONOR STICK PINS INTO MAPS BUT TO FIGHT BEAT THE ENEMY KEEP HIM OUT OFRUSSIA AND NOT LET THE ARMY GET DISCOURAGEDTO THE THIRD PARTYIN WHICH THE EMPEROR HAD MOST CONFIDENCEBELONGED THECOURTIERS WHO TRIED TO ARRANGE COMPROMISES

THAT UNDOUBTEDLY WAR PARTICULARLYAGAINST SUCH A GENIUS AS BONAPARTE THEY CALLED HIM BONAPARTE NOWNEEDS MOST DEEPLY DEVISED PLANS AND PROFOUND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ANDIN THAT RESPECT PFUEL WAS A GENIUS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAD TO BEACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE THEORISTS ARE OFTEN ONESIDED AND THEREFORE ONESHOULD NOT TRUST THEM ABSOLUTELY BUT SHOULD ALSO LISTEN TO WHAT PFUELSOPPONENTS AND PRACTICAL MEN OF EXPERIENCE IN WARFARE HAD TO SAY ANDTHEN CHOOSE A MIDDLE COURSE THEY INSISTED ON THE RETENTION OF THE CAMPAT DRISSA ACCORDING TO PFUELS PLAN BUT ON CHANGING THE MOVEMENTS OFTHE OTHER ARMIES THOUGH BY THIS COURSE NEITHER ONE AIM NOR THE OTHERCOULD BE ATTAINED YET IT SEEMED BEST TO THE ADHERENTS OF THIS THIRDPARTYOF A FOURTH OPINION THE MOST CONSPICUOUS REPRESENTATIVE WAS THETSARVICH WHO COULD NOT FORGET HIS DISILLUSIONMENT AT AUSTERLITZ WHEREHE HAD RIDDEN OUT AT THE HEAD OF THE GUARDS IN HIS CASQUE AND CAVALRYUNIFORM AS TO A REVIEW EXPECTING TO CRUSH THE FRENCH GALLANTLY BUTUNEXPECTEDLY

WAS POSSIBLE TO SUCCEED IN MANY WAYS UNTHINKABLE ATOTHER TIMES A MAN WHO SIMPLY WISHED TO RETAIN HIS LUCRATIVE POST WOULDTODAY AGREE WITH PFUEL TOMORROW WITH HIS OPPONENT AND THE DAY AFTERMERELY TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY OR TO PLEASE THE EMPEROR WOULD DECLARETHAT HE HAD NO OPINION AT ALL ON THE MATTER ANOTHER WHO WISHED TOGAIN SOME ADVANTAGE WOULD ATTRACT THE EMPERORS ATTENTION BY LOUDLYADVOCATING THE VERY THING THE EMPEROR HAD HINTED AT THE DAY BEFOREAND WOULD DISPUTE AND SHOUT AT THE COUNCIL BEATING HIS BREAST ANDCHALLENGING THOSE WHO DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM TO DUELS THEREBY PROVINGTHAT HE WAS

PROPOSED A PERFECTLY NEW POSITIONAWAY FROM THE PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW ROADS THE REASON FOR THIS WASINEXPLICABLE UNLESS HE WISHED TO SHOW THAT HE TOO COULD HAVE ANOPINION BUT HE URGED THAT AT THIS POINT THE ARMY SHOULD UNITE ANDTHERE AWAIT THE ENEMY IT WAS PLAIN THAT ARMFELDT HAD THOUGHT OUT THATPLAN LONG AGO AND NOW EXPOUNDED IT NOT SO MUCH TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONSPUTWHICH IN FACT HIS PLAN DID NOT

AGAINST ANYONE AND ONLY DESIRED THAT THE PLAN FORMED ON ATHEORY ARRIVED AT BY YEARS OF TOIL SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT HE WASRIDICULOUS AND UNPLEASANTLY SARCASTIC BUT YET HE INSPIRED INVOLUNTARYRESPECT BY HIS BOUNDLESS DEVOTION TO AN IDEA BESIDES THIS THE REMARKSOF ALL EXCEPT PFUEL HAD ONE COMMON TRAIT THAT HAD NOT BEEN NOTICEABLEAT THE COUNCIL OF WAR IN  THERE WAS NOW A PANIC FEAR OF NAPOLEONSGENIUS WHICH THOUGH CONCEALED WAS NOTICEABLE IN EVERY REJOINDEREVERYTHING WAS ASSUMED TO BE POSSIBLE FOR NAPOLEON THEY EXPECTED HIMFROM EVERY SIDE AND INVOKED HIS TERRIBLE NAME TO SHATTER EACH

SOUNDNESS TO THE WHOLE WORLDWAS SLIPPING AWAY FROM HIMTHE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUED A LONG TIME AND THE LONGER THEY LASTEDTHE MORE HEATED BECAME THE DISPUTES CULMINATING IN SHOUTS ANDPERSONALITIES AND THE LESS WAS IT POSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT ANY GENERALCONCLUSION FROM ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID PRINCE ANDREW LISTENING TO THISPOLYGLOT TALK AND TO THESE SURMISES PLANS REFUTATIONS AND SHOUTSFELT NOTHING BUT AMAZEMENT AT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING A THOUGHT THAT HADLONG SINCE AND OFTEN OCCURRED TO HIM DURING HIS MILITARY ACTIVITIESTHEIDEA THAT THERE IS NOT AND CANNOT BE ANY SCIENCE OF WAR AND THATTHEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS A MILITARY GENIUSNOW APPEAREDTO HIM AN OBVIOUS TRUTH WHAT THEORY AND SCIENCE IS POSSIBLE ABOUT AMATTER THE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH ARE UNKNOWN AND CANNOTBE DEFINED ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STRENGTH OF THE ACTING FORCES CANNOT BEASCERTAINED NO ONE WAS OR IS ABLE TO FORESEE IN WHAT CONDITION OUR ORTHE ENEMYS ARMIES WILL BE IN A DAYS TIME AND NO ONE CAN GAUGE THEFORCE OF THIS OR THAT DETACHMENT SOMETIMESWHEN THERE IS NOT A COWARDAT THE FRONT TO SHOUT WE ARE CUT OFF AND START RUNNING BUT A BRAVEAND JOLLY LAD WHO SHOUTS HURRAHA DETACHMENT OF FIVE THOUSANDIS WORTH THIRTY THOUSAND AS AT SCHN GRABERN WHILE AT TIMES FIFTYTHOUSAND RUN FROM EIGHT THOUSAND AS AT AUSTERLITZ WHAT SCIENCE CANTHERE BE IN A MATTER IN WHICH AS IN ALL PRACTICAL MATTERS NOTHINGCAN BE DEFINED AND EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON INNUMERABLE CONDITIONS THESIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT WHICH ARRIVESNO ONE KNOWS WHEN ARMFELDT SAYS OUR ARMY IS CUT IN HALF AND PAULUCCISAYS WE HAVE GOT THE FRENCH ARMY BETWEEN TWO FIRES MICHAUD SAYS THATTHE WORTHLESSNESS OF THE DRISSA CAMP LIES IN HAVING THE RIVER BEHIND ITAND PFUEL SAYS THAT IS WHAT CONSTITUTES ITS STRENGTH TOLL PROPOSESONE PLAN ARMFELDT ANOTHER AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD AND ALL BAD AND THEADVANTAGES OF ANY SUGGESTIONS CAN BE SEEN ONLY AT THE MOMENT OF TRIALAND WHY DO THEY ALL SPEAK OF A MILITARY GENIUS IS A MAN A GENIUS WHOCAN ORDER BREAD TO BE BROUGHT UP AT THE RIGHT TIME AND SAY WHO IS TO GOTO THE RIGHT AND WHO TO THE LEFT IT IS ONLY BECAUSE MILITARY MEN AREINVESTED WITH POMP AND POWER AND CROWDS OF SYCHOPHANTS FLATTER POWERATTRIBUTING TO IT QUALITIES OF GENIUS IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE BESTGENERALS I HAVE KNOWN WERE ON THE CONTRARY STUPID OR ABSENTMINDEDMEN BAGRATIN WAS THE BEST NAPOLEON HIMSELF ADMITTED THAT AND OFBONAPARTE HIMSELF I REMEMBER HIS LIMITED SELFSATISFIED FACE ON THEFIELD OF AUSTERLITZ NOT ONLY DOES A GOOD ARMY COMMANDER NOT NEED ANYSPECIAL QUALITIES ON THE CONTRARY HE NEEDS THE ABSENCE OF THE HIGHESTAND BEST HUMAN ATTRIBUTESLOVE POETRY TENDERNESS AND PHILOSOPHICINQUIRING DOUBT HE SHOULD BE LIMITED FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT WHAT HEIS DOING IS VERY IMPORTANT OTHERWISE HE WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENTPATIENCE AND ONLY THEN WILL HE BE A BRAVE LEADER GOD FORBID THAT HESHOULD BE HUMANE SHOULD LOVE OR PITY OR THINK OF WHAT IS JUSTAND UNJUST IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT A THEORY OF THEIR GENIUS WASINVENTED FOR THEM LONG AGO BECAUSE THEY HAVE POWER THE SUCCESS OF AMILITARY ACTION DEPENDS NOT ON THEM BUT ON THE MAN IN THE RANKS WHOSHOUTS WE ARE LOST OR WHO SHOUTS HURRAH AND ONLY IN THE RANKSCAN ONE SERVE WITH ASSURANCE OF BEING USEFULSO THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW AS HE LISTENED TO THE TALKING AND HE ROUSEDHIMSELF ONLY WHEN PAULUCCI CALLED HIM AND EVERYONE WAS LEAVINGAT THE REVIEW NEXT

CHEERFUL AS BEFITS A GOODSOLDIER AND NOT TO THINK OF THE GENERAL TREND OF AFFAIRS BUT ONLY OFTHE TASK NEAREST TO HAND FIRST THEY CAMPED GAILY BEFORE VLNA MAKINGACQUAINTANCE WITH THE POLISH LANDOWNERS PREPARING FOR REVIEWS AND BEINGREVIEWED BY THE EMPEROR AND OTHER HIGH COMMANDERS THEN CAME AN ORDERTO RETREAT TO SVENTSYNI AND DESTROY ANY PROVISIONS THEY COULD NOT CARRYAWAY WITH THEM SVENTSYNI WAS

ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A STUPENDOUS RESULT NO ONE OF THEM AT ALLEXPECTEDNEITHER NAPOLEON NOR ALEXANDER NOR STILL LESS ANY OF THOSEWHO DID THE ACTUAL FIGHTINGTHE CAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCH ARMY IN  IS CLEAR TO USNOW NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THAT CAUSE WAS ON THE ONE HAND ITS ADVANCEINTO THE HEART OF RUSSIA LATE IN THE SEASON WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION FORA WINTER CAMPAIGN AND ON THE OTHER THE CHARACTER GIVEN TO THE WARBY THE BURNING OF RUSSIAN TOWNS AND THE HATRED OF THE FOE THIS AROUSEDAMONG THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE BUT NO ONE AT THE TIME FORESAW WHAT NOW SEEMSSO EVIDENT THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY AN ARMY OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSANDMENTHE BEST IN THE WORLD AND LED BY THE BEST GENERALCOULD BE DESTROYEDIN CONFLICT WITH A RAW ARMY OF HALF ITS NUMERICAL STRENGTH AND LED BYINEXPERIENCED COMMANDERS AS THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS NOT ONLY DID NO ONESEE THIS BUT ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO HINDER THEONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE RUSSIA WHILE ON THE FRENCH SIDE DESPITENAPOLEONS EXPERIENCE AND SOCALLED MILITARY GENIUS EVERY EFFORT WASDIRECTED TO PUSHING ON TO MOSCOW AT THE END OF THE SUMMER THAT IS TODOING THE VERY THING THAT WAS BOUND TO LEAD TO DESTRUCTIONIN HISTORICAL WORKS ON THE YEAR  FRENCH WRITERS ARE VERY FOND OFSAYING THAT NAPOLEON FELT THE DANGER OF EXTENDING HIS LINE THAT HESOUGHT A BATTLE AND THAT HIS MARSHALS ADVISED HIM TO STOP AT SMOLNSKAND OF MAKING SIMILAR STATEMENTS TO SHOW THAT THE DANGER OF THE CAMPAIGNWAS EVEN THEN UNDERSTOOD RUSSIAN AUTHORS ARE STILL FONDER OF TELLINGUS THAT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN A SCYTHIAN WAR PLAN WASADOPTED TO LURE NAPOLEON INTO THE DEPTHS OF RUSSIA AND THIS PLAN SOMEOF THEM ATTRIBUTE TO PFUEL OTHERS TO A CERTAIN FRENCHMAN OTHERS TOTOLL AND OTHERS AGAIN TO ALEXANDER HIMSELFPOINTING TO NOTES PROJECTSAND LETTERS WHICH CONTAIN HINTS OF SUCH A LINE OF ACTION BUT ALL THESEHINTS AT WHAT HAPPENED BOTH FROM THE FRENCH SIDE AND THE RUSSIAN AREADVANCED ONLY BECAUSE THEY FIT IN WITH THE EVENT HAD THAT EVENT NOTOCCURRED THESE HINTS WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN AS WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THETHOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF HINTS AND EXPECTATIONS TO THE CONTRARYWHICH WERE CURRENT THEN BUT HAVE NOW BEEN FORGOTTEN BECAUSE THE EVENTFALSIFIED THEM THERE ARE ALWAYS SO MANY CONJECTURES AS TO THE ISSUE OFANY EVENT THAT HOWEVER IT MAY END THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE TO SAYI SAID THEN THAT IT WOULD BE SO QUITE FORGETTING THAT AMID THEIRINNUMERABLE CONJECTURES MANY WERE TO QUITE THE CONTRARY EFFECTCONJECTURES AS TO NAPOLEONS AWARENESS OF THE DANGER OF EXTENDING HISLINE AND ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE AS TO LURING THE ENEMY INTO THE DEPTHSOF RUSSIA ARE EVIDENTLY OF THAT KIND AND ONLY BY MUCH STRAINING CANHISTORIANS ATTRIBUTE SUCH CONCEPTIONS TO NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALSOR SUCH PLANS TO THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS ALL THE FACTS ARE IN FLATCONTRADICTION TO SUCH CONJECTURES DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THE WARNOT ONLY WAS THERE NO WISH ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE TO DRAW THE FRENCHINTO THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY BUT FROM THEIR FIRST ENTRY INTO RUSSIAEVERYTHING WAS DONE TO STOP THEM AND NOT ONLY WAS NAPOLEON NOT AFRAIDTO EXTEND HIS LINE BUT HE WELCOMED EVERY STEP FORWARD AS A TRIUMPH ANDDID NOT SEEK BATTLE AS EAGERLY AS IN FORMER CAMPAIGNS BUT VERY LAZILYAT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE WAR OUR ARMIES WERE DIVIDED AND OUR SOLEAIM WAS TO UNITE THEM THOUGH UNITING THE ARMIES WAS NO ADVANTAGE IF WEMEANT TO RETIRE AND LURE THE ENEMY INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTRY OUREMPEROR JOINED THE ARMY TO ENCOURAGE IT TO DEFEND EVERY INCH OF RUSSIANSOIL AND NOT TO RETREAT THE ENORMOUS DRISSA CAMP WAS FORMED ON PFUELSPLAN AND THERE WAS NO INTENTION OF RETIRING FARTHER THE EMPERORREPROACHED THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF FOR EVERY STEP THEY RETIRED HE COULDNOT BEAR THE IDEA OF LETTING THE ENEMY EVEN REACH SMOLNSK STILL LESSCOULD HE CONTEMPLATE THE BURNING OF MOSCOW AND WHEN OUR ARMIES DIDUNITE HE WAS DISPLEASED THAT SMOLNSK WAS ABANDONED AND BURNED WITHOUT AGENERAL ENGAGEMENT HAVING BEEN FOUGHT UNDER ITS WALLSSO THOUGHT THE EMPEROR AND THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS AND PEOPLE WERE STILLMORE PROVOKED AT THE THOUGHT THAT OUR FORCES WERE RETREATING INTO THEDEPTHS OF THE COUNTRYNAPOLEON HAVING CUT OUR ARMIES APART ADVANCED FAR INTO THE COUNTRY ANDMISSED SEVERAL CHANCES OF FORCING AN ENGAGEMENT IN AUGUST HE WAS ATSMOLNSK AND THOUGHT ONLY OF HOW TO ADVANCE FARTHER THOUGH AS WE NOWSEE THAT ADVANCE WAS EVIDENTLY RUINOUS TO HIMTHE FACTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT NAPOLEON DID NOT FORESEE THE DANGER OF THEADVANCE ON MOSCOW NOR DID ALEXANDER AND THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS THENTHINK OF LURING NAPOLEON ON BUT QUITE THE CONTRARY THE LURING OFNAPOLEON INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTRY WAS NOT THE RESULT OF ANY PLANFOR NO ONE BELIEVED IT TO BE POSSIBLE IT RESULTED FROM A MOST COMPLEXINTERPLAY OF INTRIGUES AIMS AND WISHES AMONG THOSE WHO TOOK PART INTHE WAR AND HAD NO PERCEPTION WHATEVER OF THE INEVITABLE OR OF THE ONEWAY OF SAVING RUSSIA EVERYTHING CAME ABOUT FORTUITOUSLY THE ARMIESWERE DIVIDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN WE TRIED TO UNITETHEM WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF GIVING BATTLE AND CHECKING THEENEMYS ADVANCE AND BY THIS EFFORT TO UNITE THEM WHILE AVOIDING BATTLEWITH A MUCH STRONGER ENEMY AND NECESSARILY WITHDRAWING THE ARMIES ATAN ACUTE ANGLEWE LED THE FRENCH ON TO SMOLNSK BUT WE WITHDREW AT ANACUTE ANGLE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE FRENCH ADVANCED BETWEEN OUR TWO ARMIESTHE ANGLE BECAME STILL MORE ACUTE AND WE WITHDREW STILL FARTHER

NOT TO COME UNDERTHE COMMAND OF THE DETESTED FOREIGNER BARCLAY WHOSE RANK WAS INFERIORTO HIS OWNTHE EMPEROR WAS WITH THE ARMY TO ENCOURAGE IT BUT HIS PRESENCE ANDIGNORANCE OF WHAT STEPS TO TAKE AND THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ADVISERS ANDPLANS DESTROYED THE FIRST ARMYS ENERGY AND IT RETIREDTHE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE A STAND AT THE DRISSA CAMP BUT PAULUCCIAIMING AT BECOMING COMMANDER IN CHIEF

WERE DIVIDED THERE WAS NO UNITY OFCOMMAND AND BARCLAY WAS UNPOPULAR BUT FROM THIS CONFUSION DIVISIONAND THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE FOREIGN COMMANDER IN CHIEF THERE RESULTEDON THE ONE HAND INDECISION AND

THING THAT RECALLED THE PATRIOTIC FERVOR EVERYONE HADDISPLAYED DURING THE EMPERORS STAY WAS THE CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OFMEN AND MONEY A NECESSITY THAT AS SOON AS THE PROMISES HAD BEEN MADEASSUMED A LEGAL OFFICIAL FORM AND BECAME UNAVOIDABLEWITH THE ENEMYS APPROACH TO MOSCOW THE MOSCOVITES VIEW OF THEIRSITUATION DID NOT GROW MORE SERIOUS BUT ON THE CONTRARY BECAME EVENMORE FRIVOLOUS AS ALWAYS HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WHO SEE A GREAT DANGERAPPROACHING AT THE APPROACH OF DANGER THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO VOICES THATSPEAK WITH EQUAL POWER IN THE HUMAN SOUL ONE VERY REASONABLY TELLS AMAN TO CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE DANGER AND THE MEANS OF ESCAPING ITTHE OTHER STILL MORE REASONABLY SAYS THAT IT IS TOO DEPRESSING ANDPAINFUL TO THINK OF THE DANGER SINCE IT IS NOT IN MANS POWER TOFORESEE EVERYTHING AND AVERT THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND IT ISTHEREFORE BETTER TO DISREGARD WHAT IS PAINFUL TILL IT COMES AND TOTHINK ABOUT WHAT IS PLEASANT IN SOLITUDE A MAN GENERALLY LISTENS TOTHE FIRST VOICE BUT IN

PIERRE WAS APPROACHINGMOZHYSKEVERY HOUSE IN MOZHYSK HAD SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN IT AND AT THE HOSTELWHERE PIERRE WAS MET BY HIS GROOM AND COACHMAN THERE WAS NO ROOM TO BEHAD IT WAS FULL OF

AND THEFARTHER HE LEFT MOSCOW BEHIND AND THE DEEPER HE PLUNGED INTO THAT SEAOF TROOPS THE MORE WAS HE OVERCOME BY RESTLESS AGITATION AND A NEW ANDJOYFUL FEELING HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE IT WAS A FEELING AKINTO WHAT HE HAD FELT AT THE SLOBDA PALACE DURING THE EMPERORS VISITASENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF UNDERTAKING SOMETHING AND SACRIFICINGSOMETHING HE NOW EXPERIENCED A GLAD CONSCIOUSNESS THAT EVERYTHING THATCONSTITUTES MENS HAPPINESSTHE COMFORTS OF LIFE WEALTH EVENLIFE ITSELFIS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY COMPARED WITHSOMETHING WITH WHAT PIERRE COULD NOT SAY AND HE DID NOT TRY TODETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT INSACRIFICING EVERYTHING HE WAS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT TOSACRIFICE FOR THE FACT OF SACRIFICING IN ITSELF AFFORDED HIM A NEW ANDJOYOUS SENSATIONCHAPTER XIXON THE TWENTYFOURTH OF AUGUST THE BATTLE OF THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBT WASFOUGHT ON THE TWENTYFIFTH NOT A SHOT WAS FIRED BY EITHER SIDE AND ONTHE TWENTYSIXTH THE BATTLE OF BORODIN ITSELF TOOK PLACEWHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVRDINO AND BORODIN GIVEN ANDACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODIN FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEASTSENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULTFOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE THAT WE WERE BROUGHT NEARERTO THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOWWHICH WE FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING INTHE WORLD AND FOR THE FRENCH ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WEREBROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR WHOLE ARMYWHICH THEY FEAREDMORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WHAT THE RESULT MUST BE WAS QUITEOBVIOUS AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLEIF THE COMMANDERS HAD BEEN GUIDED BY REASON IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT MUSTHAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO NAPOLEON THAT BY ADVANCING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILESAND GIVING BATTLE WITH A PROBABILITY OF LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMYHE WAS ADVANCING TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EQUALLYCLEAR TO KUTZOV THAT BY ACCEPTING BATTLE AND RISKING THE LOSS OF AQUARTER OF HIS ARMY HE WOULD CERTAINLY LOSE MOSCOW FOR KUTZOV THIS WASMATHEMATICALLY CLEAR AS IT IS THAT IF WHEN PLAYING DRAUGHTS I HAVE ONEMAN LESS AND GO ON EXCHANGING I SHALL CERTAINLY LOSE AND THEREFORESHOULD NOT EXCHANGE WHEN MY OPPONENT HAS SIXTEEN MEN AND I HAVEFOURTEEN I AM ONLY ONE EIGHTH WEAKER THAN HE BUT WHEN I HAVE EXCHANGEDTHIRTEEN MORE MEN HE WILL BE THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS I AMBEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODIN OUR STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO THE FRENCHWAS ABOUT AS FIVE TO SIX BUT AFTER THAT BATTLE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THANONE TO TWO PREVIOUSLY WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED ANDTWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST AHUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTZOV ACCEPTED THEBATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON WHO WAS SAID TO BE A COMMANDER OF GENIUSGAVE IT LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY AND LENGTHENING HIS LINES OFCOMMUNICATION STILL MORE IF IT IS SAID THAT HE EXPECTED TO END THECAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING MOSCOW AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BYOCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEONSHISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLNSK ONWARDS HE WISHEDTO STOP KNEW THE DANGER OF HIS EXTENDED POSITION AND KNEW THAT THEOCCUPATION OF MOSCOW WOULD NOT BE THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR HE HADSEEN AT SMOLNSK THE STATE IN WHICH RUSSIAN TOWNS WERE LEFT TO HIM ANDHAD NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE REPLY TO HIS REPEATED ANNOUNCEMENTS OF HISWISH TO NEGOTIATEIN GIVING AND ACCEPTING BATTLE AT BORODIN KUTZOV ACTED INVOLUNTARILYAND IRRATIONALLY BUT LATER ON TO FIT WHAT HAD OCCURRED THE HISTORIANSPROVIDED CUNNINGLY DEVISED EVIDENCE OF THE FORESIGHT AND GENIUS OF THEGENERALS WHO OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVEDAND INVOLUNTARYTHE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISHTHE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY AND WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO ACCUSTOMOURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT FOR OUR EPOCH HISTORIES OF THAT KIND AREMEANINGLESSON THE OTHER QUESTION HOW THE BATTLE OF BORODIN AND THE PRECEDINGBATTLE OF SHEVRDINO WERE FOUGHT THERE ALSO EXISTS A DEFINITE ANDWELLKNOWN BUT QUITE FALSE CONCEPTION ALL THE HISTORIANS DESCRIBE THEAFFAIR AS FOLLOWSTHE RUSSIAN ARMY THEY SAY IN ITS RETREAT FROM SMOLNSK SOUGHT OUTFOR ITSELF THE BEST POSITION FOR A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT AND FOUND SUCH APOSITION AT BORODINTHE RUSSIANS THEY SAY FORTIFIED THIS POSITION IN ADVANCE ON THE LEFTOF THE HIGHROAD FROM MOSCOW TO SMOLNSK AND ALMOST AT A RIGHT ANGLETO IT FROM BORODIN TO UTTSA AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WASFOUGHTIN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ONTHE SHEVRDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTYFOURTH WEARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT AND ON THETWENTYSIXTH ATTACKED THE WHOLE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WAS IN POSITION ONTHE FIELD OF BORODINSO THE HISTORIES SAY AND IT IS ALL QUITE WRONG AS ANYONE WHO CARES TOLOOK INTO THE MATTER CAN EASILY CONVINCE HIMSELFTHE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEK OUT THE BEST POSITION BUT ON THE CONTRARYDURING THE RETREAT PASSED MANY POSITIONS BETTER THAN BORODIN THEY DIDNOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTZOV DID NOT WISH TOOCCUPY A POSITION HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMANDFOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSEMILORDOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHERREASONS THE FACT IS THAT OTHER POSITIONS THEY HAD PASSED WERE STRONGERAND THAT THE POSITION AT BORODIN THE ONE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHTFAR FROM BEING STRONG WAS NO MORE A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER SPOT ONEMIGHT FIND IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BY STICKING A PIN INTO THE MAP ATHAZARDNOT ONLY DID THE RUSSIANS NOT FORTIFY THE POSITION ON THE FIELD OFBORODIN TO THE LEFT OF AND AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE HIGHROAD THATIS THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THETWENTYFIFTH OF AUGUST  DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BEFOUGHT THERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NOENTRENCHMENTS THERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH AND THAT THOSE BEGUN ON THETWENTYFIFTH AND TWENTYSIXTH WERE NOT COMPLETED AND SECONDLY BY THEPOSITION OF THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBT THAT REDOUBT WAS QUITE SENSELESSIN FRONT OF THE POSITION WHERE THE BATTLE WAS ACCEPTED WHY WAS ITMORE STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTSEXHAUSTED AND SIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE ATNIGHT ON THE TWENTYFOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TOOBSERVE THE ENEMY THIRDLY AS PROOF THAT THE POSITION ON WHICH THEBATTLE WAS FOUGHT HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND THAT THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBTWAS NOT AN ADVANCED POST OF THAT POSITION WE HAVE THE FACT THAT UP TOTHE TWENTYFIFTH BARCLAY DE TOLLY AND BAGRATIN WERE CONVINCED THAT THESHEVRDINO REDOUBT WAS THE LEFT FLANK OF THE POSITION AND THAT KUTZOVHIMSELF IN HIS REPORT WRITTEN IN HOT HASTE AFTER THE BATTLE SPEAKS OFTHE SHEVRDINO REDOUBT AS THE LEFT FLANK OF THE POSITION IT WAS MUCHLATER WHEN REPORTS ON THE BATTLE OF BORODIN WERE WRITTEN AT LEISURETHAT THE INCORRECT AND EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT WAS INVENTED PROBABLY TOJUSTIFY THE MISTAKES OF A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO HAD TO BE REPRESENTEDAS INFALLIBLE THAT THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POSTWHEREASIN REALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANKAND THATTHE BATTLE OF BORODIN WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITIONPREVIOUSLY SELECTED WHEREAS IT WAS FOUGHT ON A QUITE UNEXPECTED SPOTWHICH WAS ALMOST UNENTRENCHEDTHE CASE WAS EVIDENTLY THIS A POSITION WAS SELECTED ALONG THE RIVERKOLOCHWHICH CROSSES THE HIGHROAD NOT AT A RIGHT ANGLE BUT AT AN ACUTEANGLESO THAT THE LEFT FLANK WAS AT SHEVRDINO THE RIGHT FLANK NEAR THEVILLAGE OF NVOE AND THE CENTER AT BORODIN AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THERIVERS KOLOCH AND VYNATO ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THE FIELD OF BORODIN WITHOUT THINKING OF HOWTHE BATTLE WAS ACTUALLY FOUGHT THIS POSITION PROTECTED BY THE RIVERKOLOCH PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TOPREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLNSK ROAD TO MOSCOWNAPOLEON RIDING TO VALEVO ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DID NOT SEE AS THEHISTORY BOOKS SAY HE DID THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANS FROM UTTSATO BORODIN HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT DID NOTEXIST NOR DID HE SEE AN ADVANCED POST OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY BUT WHILEPURSUING THE RUSSIAN REARGUARD HE CAME UPON THE LEFT FLANK OF THERUSSIAN POSITIONAT THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBTAND UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THERUSSIANS MOVED HIS ARMY ACROSS THE KOLOCH AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVINGTIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THEPOSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICHHAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED BY CROSSING TO THE OTHERSIDE OF THE KOLOCH TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHROAD NAPOLEON SHIFTED THEWHOLE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT LOOKING FROM THE RUSSIANSIDE AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PLAIN BETWEEN UTTSA SEMNOVSK ANDBORODINA PLAIN NO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER PLAININ RUSSIAAND THERE THE WHOLE BATTLE OF THE TWENTYSIXTH OF AUGUST TOOKPLACEHAD NAPOLEON NOT RIDDEN OUT ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTYFOURTH TO THEKOLOCH AND HAD HE NOT THEN ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE ATTACK ON THE REDOUBTBUT HAD BEGUN THE ATTACK NEXT MORNING NO ONE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED THATTHE SHEVRDINO REDOUBT WAS THE LEFT FLANK OF OUR POSITION AND THEBATTLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHERE WE EXPECTED IT IN THAT CASEWE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE DEFENDED THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBTOUR LEFTFLANKSTILL MORE OBSTINATELY WE SHOULD HAVE ATTACKED NAPOLEON IN THECENTER OR ON THE RIGHT AND THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THETWENTYFIFTH IN THE POSITION WE INTENDED AND HAD FORTIFIED BUT AS THEATTACK ON OUR LEFT FLANK TOOK PLACE IN THE EVENING AFTER THE RETREAT OFOUR REAR GUARD THAT IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIGHT AT GRIDNVA ANDAS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN AGENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTYFOURTH THE FIRSTAND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODIN WAS ALREADY LOST ON THETWENTYFOURTH AND OBVIOUSLY LED TO THE LOSS OF THE ONE FOUGHT ON THETWENTYSIXTHAFTER THE LOSS OF THE SHEVRDINO REDOUBT WE FOUND OURSELVES ON THEMORNING OF THE TWENTYFIFTH WITHOUT A POSITION FOR OUR LEFT FLANK ANDWERE FORCED TO BEND IT BACK AND HASTILY ENTRENCH IT WHERE IT CHANCED TOBENOT ONLY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMY ON THE TWENTYSIXTH DEFENDED BY WEAKUNFINISHED ENTRENCHMENTS BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT POSITION WASINCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERSNOT HAVING FULLYREALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED NAMELY THE LOSS OF OUR POSITION ON THE LEFTFLANK AND THE SHIFTING OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROMRIGHT TO LEFTMAINTAINED THEIR EXTENDED POSITION FROM THE VILLAGE OFNVOE TO UTTSA AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO MOVE THEIR FORCES FROM RIGHT TOLEFT DURING THE BATTLE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BATTLETHE RUSSIANS OPPOSED THE ENTIRE FRENCH ARMY LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR LEFTFLANK WITH BUT HALF AS MANY MEN PONIATOWSKIS ACTION AGAINST UTTSAAND UVROVS ON THE RIGHT FLANK AGAINST THE FRENCH WERE ACTIONSDISTINCT FROM THE MAIN COURSE OF THE BATTLE SO THE BATTLE OF BORODINDID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL AS IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL OUR COMMANDERSMISTAKES EVEN AT THE COST OF DIMINISHING THE GLORY DUE TO THE RUSSIANARMY AND PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THE BATTLE OF BORODIN WAS NOTFOUGHT ON A CHOSEN AND ENTRENCHED POSITION WITH FORCES ONLY SLIGHTLYWEAKER THAN THOSE OF THE ENEMY BUT AS A RESULT OF THE LOSS OF THESHEVRDINO REDOUBT THE RUSSIANS FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF BORODIN ON ANOPEN AND ALMOST UNENTRENCHED POSITION WITH FORCES ONLY HALF AS NUMEROUSAS THE FRENCH THAT IS TO SAY UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH IT WAS NOTMERELY UNTHINKABLE TO FIGHT FOR TEN HOURS AND SECURE AN INDECISIVERESULT BUT UNTHINKABLE TO KEEP AN ARMY EVEN FROM COMPLETEDISINTEGRATION AND FLIGHTCHAPTER XXON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTYFIFTH PIERRE WAS LEAVING MOZHYSK AT THEDESCENT OF THE HIGH STEEP HILL DOWN WHICH A WINDING ROAD LED OUT OF THETOWN PAST THE CATHEDRAL ON THE RIGHT WHERE A SERVICE WAS BEING HELD ANDTHE BELLS WERE RINGING

IF ONE ALLOWSONESELF TO REGARD THE ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT RELIGIOUS AWE OF HIS GENIUSRELATED TO NAPOLEONS ORDERS TO DEAL WITH FOUR POINTSFOUR DIFFERENTORDERS NOT ONE OF THESE WAS OR COULD BE CARRIED OUTIN THE DISPOSITION IT IS SAID FIRST THAT THE BATTERIES PLACED ON THESPOT CHOSEN BY NAPOLEON WITH THE GUNS OF PERNETTI AND FOUCH WHICHWERE TO COME IN LINE WITH THEM  GUNS IN ALL WERE TO OPEN FIRE ANDSHOWER SHELLS ON THE RUSSIAN FLCHES AND REDOUBTS THIS COULD NOT BEDONE AS FROM THE SPOTS SELECTED BY NAPOLEON THE PROJECTILES DID NOTCARRY TO THE RUSSIAN WORKS AND THOSE  GUNS SHOT INTO THE AIR

TO ADVANCESIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE FRONTALL THIS LIKE THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DISPOSITION WAS NOT AND COULDNOT BE EXECUTED AFTER PASSING THROUGH BORODIN THE VICEKING WAS DRIVENBACK TO THE KOLOCH AND COULD GET NO FARTHER WHILE THE DIVISIONS OFMORAND AND GRARD DID NOT TAKE THE REDOUBT BUT WERE DRIVEN BACK AND THEREDOUBT WAS ONLY TAKEN AT THE END OF THE BATTLE BY THE CAVALRY A THINGPROBABLY UNFORESEEN AND NOT HEARD OF BY NAPOLEON SO NOT ONE OFTHE ORDERS IN THE DISPOSITION WAS OR COULD BE EXECUTED BUT IN THEDISPOSITION IT IS SAID THAT AFTER THE FIGHT HAS COMMENCED IN THISMANNER ORDERS WILL BE GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ENEMYS MOVEMENTSAND SO IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BEMADE BY NAPOLEON DURING THE BATTLE BUT THIS WAS NOT AND COULD NOT BEDONE FOR DURING THE WHOLE BATTLE NAPOLEON WAS SO FAR AWAY THAT ASAPPEARED LATER HE COULD NOT KNOW THE COURSE OF THE BATTLE AND NOT ONEOF HIS ORDERS DURING THE FIGHT COULD BE EXECUTEDCHAPTER XXVIIIMANY HISTORIANS SAY THAT THE FRENCH DID NOT WIN THE BATTLE OF BORODINBECAUSE NAPOLEON HAD A COLD AND THAT IF HE HAD NOT HAD A COLD THEORDERS HE GAVE BEFORE AND DURING THE BATTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MOREFULL OF GENIUS AND RUSSIA WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AND THE FACE OF THE WORLDHAVE BEEN CHANGED TO HISTORIANS WHO BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA WAS SHAPEDBY THE WILL OF ONE MANPETER THE GREATAND THAT FRANCE FROM A REPUBLICBECAME AN EMPIRE AND FRENCH ARMIES WENT TO RUSSIA AT THE WILL OF ONEMANNAPOLEONTO SAY THAT RUSSIA REMAINED A POWER BECAUSE NAPOLEON HAD ABAD COLD ON THE TWENTYFOURTH OF AUGUST MAY SEEM LOGICAL AND CONVINCINGIF IT HAD DEPENDED ON NAPOLEONS WILL TO FIGHT OR NOT TO FIGHT THEBATTLE OF BORODIN AND IF THIS OR THAT OTHER ARRANGEMENT DEPENDED ONHIS WILL THEN EVIDENTLY A COLD AFFECTING THE MANIFESTATION OF HIS WILLMIGHT HAVE SAVED RUSSIA AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALET WHO OMITTED TO BRINGNAPOLEON HIS WATERPROOF BOOTS ON THE TWENTYFOURTH WOULD HAVE BEENTHE SAVIOR OF RUSSIA ALONG THAT LINE OF THOUGHT SUCH A DEDUCTION ISINDUBITABLE AS INDUBITABLE AS THE DEDUCTION VOLTAIRE MADE IN JESTWITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS JESTING AT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE MASSACREOF ST BARTHOLOMEW WAS DUE TO CHARLES IXS STOMACH BEING DERANGED BUTTO MEN WHO DO NOT ADMIT THAT RUSSIA WAS FORMED BY THE WILL OF ONE MANPETER I OR THAT THE FRENCH EMPIRE WAS FORMED AND THE WAR WITH RUSSIABEGUN BY THE WILL OF ONE MAN NAPOLEON THAT ARGUMENT SEEMS NOT MERELYUNTRUE AND IRRATIONAL BUT CONTRARY TO ALL HUMAN REALITY TO THEQUESTION OF WHAT CAUSES HISTORIC EVENTS ANOTHER ANSWER PRESENTS ITSELFNAMELY THAT THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IS PREDETERMINED FROM ONHIGHDEPENDS ON THE COINCIDENCE OF THE WILLS OF ALL WHO TAKE PART IN THEEVENTS AND THAT A NAPOLEONS INFLUENCE ON THE COURSE OF THESE EVENTS ISPURELY EXTERNAL AND FICTITIOUSSTRANGE AS AT FIRST GLANCE IT MAY SEEM TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MASSACRE OFST BARTHOLOMEW WAS NOT DUE TO CHARLES IXS WILL THOUGH HE GAVE THEORDER FOR IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS DONE AS A RESULT OF THAT ORDER ANDSTRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SLAUGHTER OF EIGHTY THOUSANDMEN AT BORODIN WAS NOT DUE TO NAPOLEONS WILL THOUGH HE ORDERED THECOMMENCEMENT AND CONDUCT OF THE BATTLE AND THOUGHT IT WAS DONEBECAUSE HE ORDERED IT STRANGE AS THESE SUPPOSITIONS APPEAR YET HUMANDIGNITYWHICH TELLS ME THAT EACH OF US IS IF NOT MORE AT LEAST NOT LESSA MAN THAN THE GREAT NAPOLEONDEMANDS THE ACCEPTANCE OF THAT SOLUTION OFTHE QUESTION AND HISTORIC INVESTIGATION ABUNDANTLY CONFIRMS ITAT THE BATTLE OF BORODIN NAPOLEON SHOT AT NO ONE AND KILLED NO ONETHAT WAS ALL DONE BY THE SOLDIERS THEREFORE IT WAS NOT HE WHO KILLEDPEOPLETHE FRENCH SOLDIERS WENT TO KILL AND BE KILLED AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINNOT BECAUSE OF NAPOLEONS ORDERS BUT BY THEIR OWN VOLITION THE WHOLEARMYFRENCH ITALIAN

ORDER TO GET FOOD AND REST AS CONQUERORS IN MOSCOW SO ITWAS NOT BECAUSE OF NAPOLEONS COMMANDS THAT THEY KILLED THEIR FELLOWMENAND IT WAS NOT NAPOLEON WHO DIRECTED THE COURSE OF THE BATTLE FOR NONEOF HIS ORDERS WERE EXECUTED AND DURING THE BATTLE HE DID NOT KNOW WHATWAS GOING ON BEFORE HIM SO THE WAY IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE KILLED ONEANOTHER WAS NOT DECIDED BY NAPOLEONS WILL BUT OCCURRED INDEPENDENTLY OFHIM IN ACCORD WITH THE WILL OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO TOOKPART IN THE COMMON ACTION IT ONLY SEEMED TO NAPOLEON THAT IT ALL TOOKPLACE BY HIS WILL AND SO THE QUESTION WHETHER HE HAD OR HAD NOT ACOLD HAS NO MORE HISTORIC INTEREST THAN THE COLD OF THE LEAST OF THETRANSPORT SOLDIERSMOREOVER THE ASSERTION MADE BY VARIOUS WRITERS THAT HIS COLD WASTHE CAUSE OF HIS DISPOSITIONS NOT BEING AS WELLPLANNED AS ON FORMEROCCASIONS AND OF HIS ORDERS DURING THE BATTLE NOT BEING AS GOOD ASPREVIOUSLY IS QUITE BASELESS WHICH AGAIN SHOWS THAT NAPOLEONS COLD ONTHE TWENTYSIXTH OF AUGUST WAS UNIMPORTANTTHE DISPOSITIONS CITED ABOVE ARE NOT AT ALL WORSE BUT ARE EVENBETTER THAN PREVIOUS DISPOSITIONS BY WHICH HE HAD WON VICTORIES HISPSEUDOORDERS DURING THE BATTLE WERE ALSO NO WORSE THAN FORMERLY BUTMUCH THE SAME AS USUAL THESE DISPOSITIONS AND ORDERS ONLY SEEM WORSETHAN PREVIOUS ONES BECAUSE THE BATTLE OF BORODIN WAS THE FIRST NAPOLEONDID NOT WIN THE PROFOUNDEST AND MOST EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND ORDERSSEEM VERY BAD AND EVERY LEARNED MILITARIST CRITICIZES THEM WITH LOOKSOF IMPORTANCE WHEN THEY RELATE TO A BATTLE THAT HAS BEEN LOST AND THEVERY WORST DISPOSITIONS AND ORDERS SEEM VERY GOOD AND SERIOUS PEOPLEFILL WHOLE VOLUMES TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR MERITS WHEN THEY RELATE TO ABATTLE THAT HAS BEEN WONTHE DISPOSITIONS DRAWN UP BY WEYROTHER FOR THE BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ WEREA MODEL OF PERFECTION FOR THAT KIND OF COMPOSITION BUT STILL THEY WERECRITICIZEDCRITICIZED FOR THEIR VERY PERFECTION FOR THEIR EXCESSIVEMINUTENESSNAPOLEON AT THE BATTLE OF BORODIN FULFILLED HIS OFFICE ASREPRESENTATIVE OF AUTHORITY AS WELL AS AND EVEN BETTER THAN AT OTHERBATTLES HE DID NOTHING HARMFUL TO THE PROGRESS OF THE BATTLE HEINCLINED TO THE MOST REASONABLE OPINIONS HE MADE NO

UP TO NAPOLEON WITH REPORTS OF THE PROGRESSOF THE ACTION BUT ALL THESE REPORTS WERE FALSE BOTH BECAUSE IT WASIMPOSSIBLE IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE TO SAY WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT ANY GIVENMOMENT AND BECAUSE MANY OF THE ADJUTANTS DID NOT GO TO THE ACTUAL PLACEOF CONFLICT BUT REPORTED WHAT THEY HAD HEARD FROM OTHERS AND ALSOBECAUSE WHILE AN ADJUTANT WAS RIDING MORE THAN A MILE TO NAPOLEONCIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED AND THE NEWS HE BROUGHT WAS ALREADY BECOMINGFALSE THUS AN ADJUTANT GALLOPED UP FROM MURAT WITH TIDINGS THATBORODIN HAD BEEN OCCUPIED AND THE BRIDGE OVER THE KOLOCH WAS IN THEHANDS OF THE

FRENCH HAD BEEN REPULSED THE FLCHES HAD IN FACT BEENRECAPTURED BY OTHER FRENCH TROOPS AND DAVOUT WAS ALIVE AND ONLYSLIGHTLY BRUISED ON THE BASIS OF THESE NECESSARILY UNTRUSTWORTHYREPORTS NAPOLEON GAVE HIS ORDERS WHICH HAD EITHER BEEN EXECUTED BEFOREHE GAVE THEM OR COULD NOT BE AND WERE NOT EXECUTEDTHE MARSHALS AND GENERALS WHO WERE NEARER TO THE FIELD OF BATTLEBUT LIKE NAPOLEON DID NOT TAKE PART IN THE ACTUAL FIGHTING AND ONLYOCCASIONALLY WENT WITHIN MUSKET RANGE MADE THEIR OWN ARRANGEMENTSWITHOUT ASKING NAPOLEON AND ISSUED ORDERS WHERE AND IN WHAT DIRECTION TOFIRE AND WHERE CAVALRY SHOULD

POSTULATES ARBITRARY AND DISCONNECTEDUNITS THE FIRST METHOD OF HISTORY IS TO TAKE AN ARBITRARILY SELECTEDSERIES OF CONTINUOUS EVENTS AND EXAMINE IT APART FROM OTHERS THOUGHTHERE IS AND CAN BE NO BEGINNING TO ANY EVENT FOR ONE EVENT ALWAYSFLOWS UNINTERRUPTEDLY FROM ANOTHERTHE SECOND METHOD IS TO CONSIDER THE ACTIONS OF SOME ONE MANA KING OR ACOMMANDERAS EQUIVALENT TO THE SUM OF MANY INDIVIDUAL

ARRIVE AT THE LAWS OF HISTORYTHE FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN EUROPE PRESENT ANEXTRAORDINARY MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE MEN LEAVE THEIR CUSTOMARYPURSUITS HASTEN FROM ONE SIDE OF EUROPE TO THE OTHER PLUNDER ANDSLAUGHTER ONE ANOTHER TRIUMPH AND ARE PLUNGED IN DESPAIR AND FOR SOMEYEARS THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE IS ALTERED AND PRESENTS AN INTENSIVEMOVEMENT WHICH FIRST INCREASES AND THEN SLACKENS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OFTHIS MOVEMENT BY WHAT LAWS WAS IT GOVERNED ASKS THE MIND OF MANTHE HISTORIANS REPLYING TO THIS QUESTION LAY BEFORE US THE SAYINGS ANDDOINGS OF A FEW DOZEN MEN IN A BUILDING IN THE CITY OF PARIS CALLINGTHESE SAYINGS AND DOINGS THE REVOLUTION THEN THEY GIVE A DETAILEDBIOGRAPHY OF NAPOLEON AND OF CERTAIN PEOPLE FAVORABLE OR HOSTILE TO HIMTELL OF THE INFLUENCE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAD ON OTHERS AND SAY THATIS WHY THIS MOVEMENT TOOK PLACE AND THOSE ARE ITS LAWSBUT THE MIND OF MAN NOT ONLY REFUSES TO BELIEVE THIS EXPLANATION BUTPLAINLY SAYS THAT THIS METHOD OF EXPLANATION IS FALLACIOUS BECAUSE INIT A WEAKER PHENOMENON IS TAKEN AS THE CAUSE OF A STRONGER THE SUM OFHUMAN WILLS PRODUCED THE REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON AND ONLY THE SUM OFTHOSE WILLS FIRST TOLERATED AND THEN DESTROYED THEMBUT EVERY TIME THERE HAVE BEEN CONQUESTS THERE HAVE BEEN CONQUERORSEVERY TIME THERE HAS BEEN A REVOLUTION IN ANY STATE THERE HAVE BEENGREAT MEN SAYS HISTORY AND INDEED HUMAN REASON REPLIES EVERY TIMECONQUERORS APPEAR THERE HAVE BEEN WARS BUT THIS DOES NOT PROVE THAT THECONQUERORS CAUSED THE WARS AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND THE LAWS OFA WAR IN THE PERSONAL ACTIVITY OF A SINGLE MAN WHENEVER I LOOK AT MYWATCH AND ITS HANDS POINT TO TEN I HEAR THE BELLS OF THE NEIGHBORINGCHURCH BUT BECAUSE THE BELLS BEGIN TO RING WHEN THE HANDS OF THE CLOCKREACH TEN I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BELLS ISCAUSED BY THE POSITION OF THE HANDS OF THE WATCHWHENEVER I SEE THE MOVEMENT OF A LOCOMOTIVE I HEAR THE WHISTLE AND SEETHE VALVES OPENING AND WHEELS TURNING BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO CONCLUDETHAT THE WHISTLING AND THE TURNING OF WHEELS ARE THE CAUSE OF THEMOVEMENT OF THE ENGINETHE PEASANTS SAY THAT A COLD WIND BLOWS IN LATE SPRING BECAUSE THE OAKSARE BUDDING AND REALLY EVERY SPRING COLD WINDS DO BLOW WHEN THE OAKIS BUDDING BUT THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSES THE COLD WINDS TO BLOWWHEN THE OAK BUDS UNFOLD I CANNOT AGREE WITH THE PEASANTS THAT THEUNFOLDING OF THE OAK BUDS IS THE CAUSE OF THE COLD WIND FOR THEFORCE OF THE WIND IS BEYOND THE INFLUENCE OF THE BUDS I SEE ONLY ACOINCIDENCE OF OCCURRENCES SUCH AS HAPPENS WITH ALL THE PHENOMENA OFLIFE AND I SEE THAT HOWEVER MUCH AND HOWEVER CAREFULLY I OBSERVE THEHANDS OF THE WATCH AND THE VALVES AND WHEELS OF THE ENGINE AND THEOAK I SHALL NOT DISCOVER THE CAUSE OF THE BELLS RINGING THE

HE WAS PREPARED TO DIE WITH THE CITYTRAIN BANDS UNDER THE WALLS OF THE CAPITAL BUT THAT HE STILL COULD NOTHELP REGRETTING HAVING BEEN LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING ANDTHAT HAD HE KNOWN IT

NONSENSE KUTZOVS EXPRESSION GREW MORE AND MOREPREOCCUPIED AND GLOOMY FROM ALL THIS TALK HE SAW ONLY ONE THING THATTO DEFEND MOSCOW WAS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE FULL MEANING OFTHOSE WORDS THAT IS TO SAY SO UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT IF ANY SENSELESSCOMMANDER WERE TO GIVE ORDERS TO FIGHT CONFUSION WOULD RESULT BUT THEBATTLE WOULD STILL NOT TAKE PLACE IT WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE THECOMMANDERS NOT MERELY ALL RECOGNIZED THE POSITION TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BUTIN THEIR CONVERSATIONS WERE ONLY DISCUSSING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER ITSINEVITABLE ABANDONMENT HOW COULD THE COMMANDERS LEAD THEIR TROOPS TOA FIELD OF BATTLE THEY CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THE LOWERGRADEOFFICERS AND EVEN THE SOLDIERS WHO TOO REASON ALSO CONSIDERED THEPOSITION IMPOSSIBLE AND THEREFORE COULD NOT GO TO FIGHT FULLY CONVINCEDAS THEY WERE OF DEFEAT IF BENNIGSEN INSISTED ON THE POSITION BEINGDEFENDED AND OTHERS STILL DISCUSSED IT THE QUESTION WAS NO LONGERIMPORTANT IN ITSELF BUT ONLY AS A PRETEXT FOR DISPUTES AND INTRIGUETHIS KUTZOV KNEW WELLBENNIGSEN WHO HAD CHOSEN THE POSITION WARMLY DISPLAYED HIS RUSSIANPATRIOTISM KUTZOV COULD NOT LISTEN TO THIS WITHOUT WINCING BYINSISTING THAT MOSCOW MUST BE

THE SUCCESS AS HIS OWN OR IF BATTLE WERE NOTGIVEN TO CLEAR HIMSELF OF THE CRIME OF ABANDONING MOSCOW BUT THISINTRIGUE DID NOT NOW OCCUPY THE OLD MANS MIND ONE TERRIBLE QUESTIONABSORBED HIM AND TO THAT QUESTION HE HEARD NO REPLY FROM ANYONE THEQUESTION FOR HIM NOW WAS HAVE I REALLY ALLOWED NAPOLEON TO REACHMOSCOW AND WHEN DID I DO SO WHEN WAS IT DECIDED CAN IT HAVE BEENYESTERDAY WHEN I ORDERED PLTOV TO RETREAT OR WAS IT THE EVENINGBEFORE WHEN I HAD A NAP AND TOLD BENNIGSEN TO ISSUE ORDERS OR WAS ITEARLIER STILL WHEN WHEN WAS THIS TERRIBLE AFFAIR DECIDED MOSCOWMUST BE ABANDONED THE ARMY MUST

IN THEM ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THATQUESTION HAS NO MEANING FOR A RUSSIAN HE LURCHED HIS HEAVY BODYFORWARD SUCH A QUESTION CANNOT BE PUT IT IS SENSELESS THE QUESTIONI HAVE ASKED THESE GENTLEMEN TO MEET TO DISCUSS IS A MILITARY ONETHE QUESTION IS THAT OF SAVING RUSSIA IS IT BETTER TO GIVE UP MOSCOWWITHOUT A BATTLE OR BY ACCEPTING BATTLE TO RISK LOSING THE ARMY AS WELLAS MOSCOW THAT IS THE QUESTION ON WHICH I WANT YOUR OPINION AND HESANK BACK IN HIS CHAIRTHE DISCUSSION BEGAN BENNIGSEN DID NOT YET CONSIDER HIS GAME LOSTADMITTING THE VIEW OF BARCLAY AND OTHERS THAT A DEFENSIVE

THAT GRANDDAD SAID SOMETHING TOLONGCOAT WHICH SETTLED HIM BENNIGSEN SUDDENLY REDDENED AND PACEDANGRILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHAT SO AFFECTED HIM WAS KUTZOVS CALMAND QUIET COMMENT ON THE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE OF BENNIGSENSPROPOSAL TO MOVE TROOPS BY NIGHT FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT FLANK TOATTACK THE FRENCH RIGHT WINGGENTLEMEN SAID KUTZOV I CANNOT APPROVE OF THE COUNTS PLAN MOVINGTROOPS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AN ENEMY IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS AND MILITARYHISTORY SUPPORTS THAT VIEW FOR INSTANCE KUTZOV SEEMED TO REFLECTSEARCHING FOR AN EXAMPLE THEN WITH A CLEAR NAVE LOOK AT BENNIGSEN HEADDED OH YES TAKE THE BATTLE OF FRIEDLAND WHICH I THINK THE COUNTWELL REMEMBERS AND WHICH WAS NOT FULLY SUCCESSFUL ONLY BECAUSE OURTROOPS WERE REARRANGED TOO NEAR THE ENEMYTHERE FOLLOWED A MOMENTARY PAUSE WHICH SEEMED VERY LONG TO THEM ALLTHE DISCUSSION RECOMMENCED BUT PAUSES FREQUENTLY OCCURRED AND THEY ALLFELT THAT THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAIDDURING ONE OF THESE PAUSES KUTZOV HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AS IF

MOSCOWROSTOPCHN WHO IS USUALLY REPRESENTED AS BEING THE INSTIGATOR OF THATEVENT ACTED IN AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT MANNER FROM KUTZOVAFTER THE BATTLE OF BORODIN THE ABANDONMENT AND BURNING OF MOSCOW WASAS INEVITABLE AS THE RETREAT OF THE ARMY BEYOND MOSCOW WITHOUT FIGHTINGEVERY RUSSIAN MIGHT HAVE PREDICTED IT NOT BY REASONING BUT BY THEFEELING IMPLANTED IN EACH OF US AND IN OUR FATHERSTHE SAME THING THAT TOOK PLACE IN MOSCOW HAD HAPPENED IN ALL THE TOWNSAND VILLAGES ON RUSSIAN SOIL BEGINNING WITH SMOLNSK WITHOUT THEPARTICIPATION OF COUNT ROSTOPCHN AND HIS BROADSHEETS THE PEOPLEAWAITED THE ENEMY UNCONCERNEDLY DID NOT RIOT OR BECOME EXCITED OR TEARANYONE TO PIECES BUT FACED ITS FATE FEELING WITHIN IT THE STRENGTH TOFIND WHAT IT SHOULD DO AT THAT MOST DIFFICULT MOMENT AND AS SOON AS THEENEMY DREW NEAR THE WEALTHY CLASSES WENT AWAY ABANDONING THEIR PROPERTYWHILE THE POORER REMAINED AND BURNED AND DESTROYED WHAT WAS LEFTTHE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS WOULD BE SO AND WOULD ALWAYS BE SO WAS ANDIS PRESENT IN THE HEART OF EVERY RUSSIAN AND A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THISAND A FOREBODING THAT MOSCOW WOULD BE TAKEN WAS PRESENT IN RUSSIANMOSCOW SOCIETY IN  THOSE WHO HAD QUITTED MOSCOW ALREADY IN JULYAND AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST SHOWED THAT THEY EXPECTED THIS THOSE WHOWENT AWAY TAKING WHAT THEY COULD AND ABANDONING THEIR HOUSES AND HALFTHEIR BELONGINGS DID SO FROM THE LATENT PATRIOTISM WHICH EXPRESSESITSELF NOT BY PHRASES OR BY GIVING ONES CHILDREN TO SAVE THE FATHERLANDAND SIMILAR UNNATURAL EXPLOITS BUT UNOBTRUSIVELY SIMPLY ORGANICALLYAND THEREFORE IN THE WAY THAT ALWAYS PRODUCES THE MOST POWERFUL RESULTSIT IS DISGRACEFUL TO RUN AWAY FROM DANGER ONLY COWARDS ARE RUNNINGAWAY FROM MOSCOW THEY WERE TOLD IN HIS BROADSHEETS ROSTOPCHNIMPRESSED ON THEM THAT TO LEAVE MOSCOW WAS SHAMEFUL THEY WERE ASHAMEDTO BE CALLED COWARDS ASHAMED TO LEAVE BUT STILL THEY LEFT KNOWINGIT HAD TO BE DONE WHY DID THEY GO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE THATROSTOPCHN HAD SCARED THEM BY HIS ACCOUNTS OF HORRORS NAPOLEON HADCOMMITTED IN CONQUERED COUNTRIES THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO AWAY WERE THERICH EDUCATED PEOPLE WHO KNEW QUITE WELL THAT VIENNA AND BERLIN HADREMAINED INTACT AND THAT DURING NAPOLEONS OCCUPATION THE INHABITANTSHAD SPENT THEIR TIME PLEASANTLY IN THE COMPANY OF THE CHARMING FRENCHMENWHOM THE RUSSIANS AND ESPECIALLY THE RUSSIAN LADIES THEN LIKED SOMUCHTHEY WENT AWAY BECAUSE FOR RUSSIANS THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION AS TOWHETHER THINGS WOULD GO WELL OR ILL UNDER FRENCH RULE IN MOSCOW IT WASOUT OF THE QUESTION TO BE UNDER FRENCH RULE IT WOULD BE THE WORST THINGTHAT COULD HAPPEN THEY WENT AWAY EVEN BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODIN ANDSTILL MORE RAPIDLY AFTER IT DESPITE ROSTOPCHNS CALLS TO DEFEND MOSCOWOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS INTENTION TO TAKE THE WONDERWORKING ICON OFTHE IBERIAN MOTHER OF GOD AND GO TO FIGHT OR OF THE BALLOONS THAT WERETO DESTROY THE FRENCH AND DESPITE ALL THE NONSENSE ROSTOPCHN WROTE INHIS BROADSHEETS THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS FOR THE ARMY TO FIGHT AND THATIF IT COULD NOT SUCCEED IT WOULD NOT DO TO TAKE YOUNG LADIES AND HOUSESERFS TO THE THREE HILLS QUARTER OF MOSCOW TO FIGHT NAPOLEON AND THATTHEY MUST GO AWAY SORRY AS THEY WERE TO ABANDON THEIR PROPERTYTO DESTRUCTION THEY WENT AWAY WITHOUT THINKING OF THE TREMENDOUSSIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IMMENSE AND WEALTHY CITY BEING GIVEN OVER TODESTRUCTION FOR A GREAT CITY WITH WOODEN BUILDINGS WAS CERTAIN WHENABANDONED BY ITS

INVITED TO ATTEND THE COUNCIL OF WAR ANDBECAUSE KUTZOV HAD PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS OFFER TO TAKE PART IN THEDEFENSE OF THE CITY AMAZED ALSO AT THE NOVEL OUTLOOK REVEALED TO HIMAT THE CAMP WHICH TREATED THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE CAPITAL AND ITSPATRIOTIC FERVOR AS NOT MERELY SECONDARY BUT QUITE IRRELEVANT ANDUNIMPORTANT MATTERS DISTRESSED OFFENDED AND SURPRISED BY ALL THISROSTOPCHN HAD RETURNED TO MOSCOW AFTER SUPPER HE LAY DOWN ON A SOFAWITHOUT UNDRESSING AND WAS AWAKENED SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT BY A COURIERBRINGING HIM A LETTER FROM KUTZOV THIS LETTER REQUESTED THE COUNT TOSEND POLICE OFFICERS TO GUIDE THE TROOPS THROUGH THE TOWN AS THE ARMYWAS RETREATING TO THE RYAZN ROAD BEYOND MOSCOW THIS WAS NOT NEWS TOROSTOPCHN HE HAD KNOWN THAT MOSCOW WOULD BE ABANDONED NOT MERELY SINCEHIS INTERVIEW THE PREVIOUS DAY WITH KUTZOV ON THE POKLNNY HILL BUTEVER SINCE THE BATTLE OF BORODIN FOR ALL THE GENERALS WHO CAME TOMOSCOW AFTER THAT BATTLE HAD SAID UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TOFIGHT ANOTHER BATTLE AND SINCE THEN THE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY HAD BEENREMOVED EVERY NIGHT AND HALF THE INHABITANTS HAD LEFT THE CITYWITH ROSTOPCHNS OWN PERMISSION YET ALL THE SAME THIS INFORMATIONASTONISHED AND IRRITATED THE COUNT COMING AS IT DID IN THE FORM OF ASIMPLE NOTE WITH AN ORDER FROM KUTZOV AND RECEIVED AT NIGHT BREAKINGIN ON HIS BEAUTY SLEEPWHEN LATER ON IN HIS MEMOIRS COUNT ROSTOPCHN EXPLAINED HIS ACTIONS ATTHIS TIME HE REPEATEDLY SAYS THAT HE WAS THEN ACTUATED BY TWO IMPORTANTCONSIDERATIONS TO MAINTAIN TRANQUILLITY IN MOSCOW AND EXPEDITE THEDEPARTURE OF THE INHABITANTS IF ONE ACCEPTS THIS TWOFOLD AIM ALLROSTOPCHNS ACTIONS APPEAR IRREPROACHABLE WHY WERE THE HOLY RELICSTHE ARMS AMMUNITION GUNPOWDER AND STORES OF CORN NOT REMOVED WHYWERE THOUSANDS OF INHABITANTS DECEIVED INTO BELIEVING THAT MOSCOW WOULDNOT BE GIVEN UPAND THEREBY RUINED TO PRESERVE THE TRANQUILLITYOF THE CITY EXPLAINS COUNT ROSTOPCHN WHY WERE BUNDLES OF USELESSPAPERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND LEPPICHS BALLOON AND OTHERARTICLES REMOVED TO LEAVE THE TOWN EMPTY EXPLAINS COUNT ROSTOPCHNONE NEED ONLY ADMIT THAT PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY IS IN DANGER AND ANY ACTIONFINDS A JUSTIFICATIONALL THE HORRORS OF THE REIGN OF TERROR WERE BASED ONLY ON SOLICITUDE FORPUBLIC TRANQUILLITYON WHAT THEN WAS COUNT ROSTOPCHNS FEAR FOR THE TRANQUILLITY OFMOSCOW BASED IN  WHAT REASON WAS THERE FOR ASSUMING ANY PROBABILITYOF AN UPRISING IN THE CITY THE INHABITANTS WERE LEAVING IT AND THERETREATING TROOPS WERE FILLING IT WHY SHOULD THAT CAUSE THE MASSES TORIOTNEITHER IN MOSCOW NOR ANYWHERE IN RUSSIA DID ANYTHING RESEMBLING ANINSURRECTION EVER OCCUR WHEN THE ENEMY ENTERED A TOWN MORE THANTEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE STILL IN MOSCOW ON THE FIRST AND SECOND OFSEPTEMBER AND EXCEPT FOR A MOB IN THE GOVERNORS COURTYARD ASSEMBLEDTHERE AT HIS BIDDING NOTHING HAPPENED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE WOULDHAVE BEEN EVEN LESS REASON TO EXPECT A DISTURBANCE AMONG THE PEOPLEIF AFTER THE BATTLE OF BORODIN WHEN THE SURRENDER OF MOSCOW BECAMECERTAIN OR AT LEAST PROBABLE ROSTOPCHN INSTEAD OF EXCITING THE PEOPLEBY DISTRIBUTING ARMS AND BROADSHEETS HAD TAKEN STEPS TO REMOVE ALLTHE HOLY RELICS THE GUNPOWDER MUNITIONS AND MONEY AND HAD TOLD THEPOPULATION PLAINLY THAT THE TOWN WOULD BE ABANDONEDROSTOPCHN THOUGH HE HAD PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS WAS A SANGUINE ANDIMPULSIVE MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS MOVED IN THE HIGHEST ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCLESAND HAD NO UNDERSTANDING AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE HE SUPPOSED HIMSELF TOBE GUIDING EVER SINCE THE ENEMYS ENTRY INTO SMOLNSK HE HAD INIMAGINATION BEEN PLAYING THE ROLE OF DIRECTOR OF THE POPULAR FEELINGOF THE HEART OF RUSSIA NOT ONLY DID IT SEEM TO HIM AS TO ALLADMINISTRATORS THAT HE CONTROLLED THE EXTERNAL ACTIONS OF MOSCOWSINHABITANTS BUT HE ALSO THOUGHT HE CONTROLLED THEIR MENTAL ATTITUDE BYMEANS OF HIS BROADSHEETS AND POSTERS WRITTEN IN A COARSE TONE WHICH THEPEOPLE DESPISE IN THEIR OWN CLASS AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND FROM THOSE INAUTHORITY ROSTOPCHN WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE FINE ROLE OF LEADER OFPOPULAR FEELING AND HAD GROWN SO USED TO IT THAT THE NECESSITY OFRELINQUISHING THAT ROLE AND ABANDONING MOSCOW WITHOUT ANY HEROIC DISPLAYTOOK HIM UNAWARES AND HE SUDDENLY FELT THE GROUND SLIP AWAY FROM UNDERHIS FEET SO THAT HE POSITIVELY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO THOUGH HE KNEWIT WAS COMING HE DID NOT TILL THE LAST MOMENT WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVETHAT MOSCOW WOULD BE ABANDONED AND DID NOT PREPARE FOR IT THEINHABITANTS LEFT AGAINST HIS WISHES IF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES WEREREMOVED THIS WAS ONLY DONE ON THE DEMAND OF OFFICIALS TO WHOM THE COUNTYIELDED RELUCTANTLY HE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ROLE HE HAD CREATEDFOR HIMSELF AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH THOSE GIFTED WITH AN ARDENTIMAGINATION THOUGH HE HAD LONG KNOWN THAT MOSCOW WOULD BE ABANDONED HEKNEW IT ONLY WITH HIS INTELLECT HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT IN HIS HEART ANDDID NOT ADAPT HIMSELF MENTALLY TO THIS NEW POSITION OF AFFAIRSALL HIS PAINSTAKING AND ENERGETIC ACTIVITY IN HOW FAR IT WAS USEFULAND HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE PEOPLE IS ANOTHER

STAYING BY THE EVENING OF THESECOND OF SEPTEMBERAFTER THE LAST TWO DAYS SPENT IN SOLITUDE AND UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCESPIERRE WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON INSANITY HE WAS COMPLETELY OBSESSEDBY ONE PERSISTENT THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW OR WHEN THIS THOUGHT HADTAKEN SUCH POSSESSION OF HIM BUT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF THE PASTUNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF THE PRESENT AND ALL HE SAW AND HEARD APPEARED TOHIM LIKE A DREAMHE HAD LEFT HOME ONLY TO ESCAPE THE INTRICATE TANGLE OF LIFES DEMANDSTHAT ENMESHED HIM AND WHICH IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION HE WAS UNABLETO UNRAVEL HE HAD GONE TO JOSEPH ALEXEVICHS HOUSE ON THE PLEA OFSORTING THE DECEASEDS BOOKS AND PAPERS ONLY IN SEARCH OF REST FROMLIFES TURMOIL FOR IN HIS MIND THE MEMORY OF JOSEPH ALEXEVICH WASCONNECTED WITH A WORLD OF ETERNAL SOLEMN AND CALM THOUGHTS QUITECONTRARY TO THE RESTLESS CONFUSION INTO WHICH HE FELT HIMSELF BEINGDRAWN HE SOUGHT A QUIET REFUGE AND IN JOSEPH ALEXEVICHS STUDY HEREALLY FOUND IT WHEN HE SAT WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE DUSTY WRITING TABLEIN THE DEATHLIKE STILLNESS OF THE STUDY CALM AND SIGNIFICANT MEMORIESOF THE LAST FEW DAYS ROSE ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATIONPARTICULARLY OF THE BATTLE OF BORODIN AND OF THAT VAGUE SENSE OF HISOWN INSIGNIFICANCE AND INSINCERITY COMPARED WITH THE TRUTH SIMPLICITYAND STRENGTH OF THE CLASS OF MEN HE MENTALLY CLASSED AS THEY WHENGERSIM ROUSED HIM FROM HIS REVERIE THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM OF TAKINGPART IN THE POPULAR DEFENSE OF MOSCOW WHICH HE KNEW WAS PROJECTED ANDWITH THAT OBJECT HE HAD ASKED GERSIM TO GET HIM A PEASANTS COAT ANDA PISTOL CONFIDING TO HIM HIS INTENTIONS OF REMAINING IN JOSEPHALEXEVICHS HOUSE AND KEEPING HIS NAME SECRET THEN DURING THE FIRSTDAY SPENT IN INACTION AND SOLITUDE HE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO FIX HISATTENTION ON THE MASONIC MANUSCRIPTS BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO THE IDEATHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED TO HIM OF THE CABALISTIC SIGNIFICANCE OFHIS NAME IN CONNECTION WITH BONAPARTES MORE THAN ONCE VAGUELY PRESENTEDITSELF BUT THE IDEA THAT HE LRUSSE BESUHOF WAS DESTINED TO SET ALIMIT TO THE POWER OF THE BEAST WAS AS YET ONLY ONE OF THE FANCIES THATOFTEN PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND AND LEFT NO TRACE BEHINDWHEN HAVING BOUGHT THE COAT MERELY WITH THE OBJECT OF TAKING PART AMONGTHE PEOPLE IN THE DEFENSE OF MOSCOW PIERRE HAD MET THE ROSTVS ANDNATSHA HAD SAID TO HIM ARE YOU REMAINING IN MOSCOW HOW SPLENDIDTHE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO HIS MIND THAT IT REALLY WOULD BE A GOOD THINGEVEN IF MOSCOW WERE TAKEN FOR HIM TO REMAIN THERE AND DO WHAT HE WASPREDESTINED TO DONEXT DAY WITH THE SOLE IDEA OF NOT SPARING HIMSELF AND NOT LAGGING INANY WAY BEHIND THEM PIERRE WENT TO THE THREE HILLS GATE BUT WHEN HERETURNED TO THE HOUSE CONVINCED THAT MOSCOW WOULD NOT BE DEFENDED HESUDDENLY FELT THAT WHAT BEFORE HAD SEEMED TO HIM MERELY A POSSIBILITYHAD NOW BECOME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE HE MUST REMAIN INMOSCOW CONCEALING HIS NAME AND MUST MEET NAPOLEON AND KILL HIM ANDEITHER PERISH OR PUT AN END TO THE MISERY OF ALL EUROPEWHICH IT SEEMEDTO HIM WAS SOLELY DUE TO NAPOLEONPIERRE KNEW ALL THE DETAILS OF THE ATTEMPT ON BONAPARTES LIFE IN BY A GERMAN STUDENT IN VIENNA AND KNEW THAT THE STUDENT HAD BEEN SHOTAND THE RISK TO WHICH HE WOULD EXPOSE HIS LIFE BY CARRYING OUT HISDESIGN EXCITED HIM STILL MORETWO EQUALLY STRONG FEELINGS DREW PIERRE IRRESISTIBLY TO THIS PURPOSETHE FIRST WAS A FEELING OF THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICE AND SUFFERING INVIEW OF THE COMMON CALAMITY THE SAME FEELING THAT HAD CAUSED HIM TO GOTO MOZHYSK ON THE TWENTYFIFTH AND TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE VERY THICKOF THE BATTLE AND HAD NOW CAUSED HIM TO RUN AWAY FROM HIS HOME AND INPLACE OF THE LUXURY AND COMFORT TO WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPON A HARD SOFA WITHOUT UNDRESSING AND EAT THE SAME FOOD AS GERSIMTHE OTHER WAS THAT VAGUE AND QUITE RUSSIAN FEELING OF CONTEMPT FOREVERYTHING CONVENTIONAL ARTIFICIAL AND HUMANFOR EVERYTHING THEMAJORITY OF MEN REGARD AS THE GREATEST GOOD IN THE WORLD PIERRE HADFIRST EXPERIENCED THIS STRANGE AND

IT CAN ALL BE RENOUNCEDIT WAS THE FEELING THAT INDUCES A VOLUNTEER RECRUIT TO SPEND HIS LASTPENNY ON DRINK AND A DRUNKEN MAN TO SMASH MIRRORS OR GLASSES FOR NOAPPARENT REASON AND KNOWING THAT IT WILL COST HIM ALL THE MONEY HEPOSSESSES THE FEELING WHICH CAUSES A MAN TO PERFORM ACTIONS WHICH FROMAN ORDINARY POINT OF VIEW ARE INSANE TO TEST AS IT WERE HIS PERSONALPOWER AND STRENGTH AFFIRMING THE EXISTENCE OF A HIGHER NONHUMANCRITERION OF LIFEFROM THE VERY DAY PIERRE HAD EXPERIENCED THIS FEELING FOR THE FIRST TIMEAT THE SLOBDA PALACE HE HAD BEEN CONTINUOUSLY UNDER ITS INFLUENCE BUTONLY NOW

THEMSELVES SAVING THEIR FATHERLANDOR WEEPING OVER ITS DOWNFALL THE TALES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THAT TIMEWITHOUT EXCEPTION SPEAK ONLY OF THE SELFSACRIFICE PATRIOTIC DEVOTIONDESPAIR GRIEF AND THE HEROISM OF THE RUSSIANS BUT IT WAS NOT REALLYSO IT APPEARS SO TO US BECAUSE WE SEE ONLY THE GENERAL HISTORICINTEREST OF THAT TIME AND DO NOT SEE ALL THE PERSONAL HUMAN INTERESTSTHAT PEOPLE HAD YET IN REALITY THOSE PERSONAL INTERESTS OF THE MOMENTSO MUCH TRANSCEND THE GENERAL INTERESTS THAT THEY ALWAYS PREVENT THEPUBLIC INTEREST FROM BEING FELT OR EVEN NOTICED MOST OF THE PEOPLE ATTHAT TIME PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF EVENTS BUT WEREGUIDED ONLY BY THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS AND THEY WERE THE VERY PEOPLEWHOSE ACTIVITIES AT THAT PERIOD WERE MOST USEFULTHOSE WHO TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND TO TAKEPART IN IT BY SELFSACRIFICE AND HEROISM WERE THE MOST USELESS MEMBERSOF SOCIETY THEY SAW EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL THEY DID FOR THECOMMON GOOD TURNED OUT TO BE USELESS AND FOOLISHLIKE PIERRES ANDMAMNOVS REGIMENTS WHICH LOOTED RUSSIAN VILLAGES AND THE LINT THEYOUNG LADIES PREPARED AND THAT NEVER REACHED THE WOUNDED AND SO ONEVEN THOSE FOND OF

NICHOLAS ROSTV TOOK A CLOSEAND PROLONGED PART IN THE DEFENSE OF HIS COUNTRY BUT DID SO CASUALLYWITHOUT ANY AIM AT SELFSACRIFICE AND HE THEREFORE LOOKED AT WHAT WASGOING ON IN RUSSIA WITHOUT DESPAIR AND WITHOUT DISMALLY RACKING HISBRAINS OVER IT HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE STATE OFRUSSIA HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUTIT THAT KUTZOV AND OTHERS WERE THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT THAT HE HADHEARD THAT THE REGIMENTS WERE TO BE MADE UP TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH THATFIGHTING WOULD PROBABLY GO ON FOR A LONG TIME YET AND THAT THINGS BEINGSO IT WAS QUITE LIKELY HE MIGHT BE IN COMMAND OF A REGIMENT IN A COUPLEOF YEARS TIMEAS HE LOOKED AT THE MATTER IN THIS WAY HE LEARNED THAT HE WAS BEINGSENT TO VORNEZH TO BUY REMOUNTS FOR HIS DIVISION NOT ONLY WITHOUTREGRET AT BEING PREVENTED FROM TAKING PART IN THE COMING BATTLE BUTWITH THE GREATEST PLEASUREWHICH HE DID NOT CONCEAL AND WHICH HISCOMRADES FULLY UNDERSTOODA FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF

DIDWERE ALL SOUND AND GOOD THERE WAS NOT A GRAYHAIR IN HIS BEARD OR ON HIS HEAD AND HIS WHOLE BODY GAVE AN IMPRESSIONOF SUPPLENESS AND ESPECIALLY OF FIRMNESS AND ENDURANCEHIS FACE DESPITE ITS FINE ROUNDED WRINKLES HAD AN EXPRESSION OFINNOCENCE AND YOUTH HIS VOICE WAS PLEASANT AND MUSICAL BUT THE CHIEFPECULIARITY OF HIS SPEECH WAS ITS DIRECTNESS AND APPOSITENESS IT WASEVIDENT THAT HE NEVER CONSIDERED WHAT HE HAD SAID OR WAS GOING TO SAYAND CONSEQUENTLY THE RAPIDITY AND JUSTICE OF HIS INTONATION HAD ANIRRESISTIBLE PERSUASIVENESSHIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND AGILITY DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF HISIMPRISONMENT WERE SUCH THAT HE SEEMED NOT TO KNOW WHAT FATIGUE ANDSICKNESS MEANT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE LYING DOWN HE SAID LORD LAY MEDOWN AS A STONE AND RAISE ME UP AS A LOAF AND EVERY MORNING ON

OUTSIDE BREECHES HE WOULD SAYHE DID NOT LIKE TALKING ABOUT HIS LIFE AS A SOLDIER THOUGH HE DID NOTCOMPLAIN AND OFTEN MENTIONED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN FLOGGED ONCE DURINGTHE WHOLE OF HIS ARMY SERVICE WHEN HE RELATED ANYTHING IT WAS GENERALLYSOME OLD AND EVIDENTLY PRECIOUS MEMORY OF HIS CHRISTIAN LIFE AS HECALLED HIS PEASANT EXISTENCE THE PROVERBS OF WHICH HIS TALK WAS FULLWERE FOR THE MOST PART NOT THE COARSE AND INDECENT SAWS SOLDIERSEMPLOY BUT THOSE FOLK SAYINGS WHICH TAKEN WITHOUT A CONTEXT SEEM SOINSIGNIFICANT BUT WHEN USED APPOSITELY SUDDENLY ACQUIRE A SIGNIFICANCEOF PROFOUND WISDOMHE WOULD OFTEN SAY THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE HAD SAID ON A PREVIOUSOCCASION YET BOTH WOULD BE RIGHT HE LIKED TO TALK AND HE TALKED WELLADORNING HIS SPEECH WITH TERMS OF ENDEARMENT AND WITH FOLK SAYINGS WHICHPIERRE THOUGHT HE INVENTED HIMSELF BUT THE CHIEF CHARM OF HIS TALK LAYIN THE FACT THAT THE COMMONEST EVENTSSOMETIMES JUST SUCH AS PIERREHAD WITNESSED WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE OF THEMASSUMED IN KARATEVS ACHARACTER OF SOLEMN FITNESS HE LIKED TO HEAR THE FOLK TALES ONE OF THESOLDIERS USED TO TELL OF AN EVENING THEY WERE ALWAYS THE SAME BUTMOST OF ALL HE LIKED TO HEAR STORIES OF REAL LIFE HE

PIERRE STRUCK BY THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS WOULD ASK HIM TOREPEAT THEM BUT PLATN COULD NEVER RECALL WHAT HE HAD SAID A MOMENTBEFORE JUST AS HE NEVER COULD REPEAT TO PIERRE THE WORDS OF HISFAVORITE SONG NATIVE AND BIRCH TREE AND MY HEART IS SICK OCCURRED INIT BUT WHEN SPOKEN AND NOT SUNG NO MEANING COULD BE GOT OUT OF IT HEDID NOT AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF WORDS APART FROMTHEIR CONTEXT

THATHE WAS QUITE WELL AND UNWOUNDED MANY VARIOUS INDIFFERENT ANDINSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE APPEARED BEFORE HIM HE TALKED TO THEM ANDDISCUSSED SOMETHING TRIVIAL THEY WERE PREPARING TO GO AWAY SOMEWHEREPRINCE ANDREW DIMLY REALIZED THAT ALL THIS WAS TRIVIAL AND THAT HE HADMORE IMPORTANT CARES BUT HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK SURPRISING THEM BYEMPTY WITTICISMS GRADUALLY UNNOTICED ALL THESE PERSONS BEGAN TODISAPPEAR AND A SINGLE QUESTION THAT OF THE CLOSED DOOR SUPERSEDEDALL ELSE HE ROSE AND WENT TO THE DOOR TO BOLT AND LOCK IT EVERYTHINGDEPENDED ON WHETHER HE WAS OR WAS NOT IN TIME TO LOCK IT HE WENT ANDTRIED TO HURRY BUT HIS LEGS REFUSED TO MOVE AND HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT BEIN TIME TO LOCK THE DOOR THOUGH HE PAINFULLY STRAINED ALL HIS POWERS HEWAS SEIZED BY AN AGONIZING FEAR AND THAT FEAR WAS THE FEAR OF DEATH ITSTOOD BEHIND THE DOOR BUT JUST WHEN HE WAS CLUMSILY CREEPING TOWARDTHE DOOR THAT DREADFUL SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS ALREADY PRESSINGAGAINST IT AND FORCING ITS WAY IN SOMETHING NOT HUMANDEATHWASBREAKING IN THROUGH THAT DOOR AND HAD TO BE KEPT OUT HE SEIZED THEDOOR MAKING A FINAL EFFORT TO HOLD IT BACKTO LOCK IT WAS NO LONGERPOSSIBLEBUT HIS EFFORTS WERE WEAK AND CLUMSY AND THE DOOR PUSHED FROMBEHIND BY THAT TERROR OPENED AND CLOSED AGAINONCE AGAIN IT PUSHED FROM OUTSIDE HIS LAST SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS WERE VAINAND BOTH HALVES OF THE DOOR NOISELESSLY OPENED IT ENTERED AND IT

ANSWER AND LOOKED ATHER STRANGELY NOT UNDERSTANDINGTHAT WAS WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TWO DAYS BEFORE PRINCESS MARYSARRIVAL FROM THAT DAY AS THE DOCTOR EXPRESSED IT THE WASTING FEVERASSUMED A MALIGNANT CHARACTER BUT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID DID NOT INTERESTNATSHA SHE SAW THE TERRIBLE MORAL SYMPTOMS WHICH TO HER WERE MORECONVINCINGFROM THAT DAY AN AWAKENING FROM LIFE CAME TO PRINCE ANDREW TOGETHER WITHHIS AWAKENING FROM SLEEP AND COMPARED TO THE DURATION OF LIFE IT DIDNOT SEEM TO HIM SLOWER THAN AN AWAKENING FROM SLEEP COMPARED TO THEDURATION OF A DREAMTHERE WAS NOTHING TERRIBLE OR VIOLENT IN THIS COMPARATIVELY SLOWAWAKENINGHIS LAST DAYS AND HOURS PASSED IN AN ORDINARY AND SIMPLE WAY BOTHPRINCESS MARY AND NATSHA WHO DID NOT LEAVE HIM FELT THIS THEY DIDNOT WEEP OR SHUDDER AND DURING THESE LAST DAYS THEY THEMSELVES FELTTHAT THEY WERE NOT ATTENDING ON HIM HE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE HAD LEFTTHEM BUT ON WHAT REMINDED THEM MOST CLOSELY OF HIMHIS BODY BOTH FELTTHIS SO STRONGLY THAT THE OUTWARD AND TERRIBLE SIDE OF DEATH DID NOTAFFECT THEM AND THEY DID NOT FEEL IT NECESSARY TO FOMENT THEIR GRIEFNEITHER IN HIS PRESENCE NOR OUT OF IT DID THEY WEEP NOR DID THEY EVERTALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT HIM THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD NOT EXPRESS INWORDS WHAT THEY UNDERSTOODTHEY BOTH SAW THAT HE WAS SINKING SLOWLY AND QUIETLY DEEPER AND DEEPERAWAY FROM THEM AND THEY BOTH KNEW THAT THIS HAD TO BE SO AND THAT ITWAS RIGHTHE CONFESSED AND RECEIVED COMMUNION EVERYONE CAME TO TAKE LEAVE OFHIM WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIS SON TO HIM HE PRESSED HIS LIPS TO THE BOYSAND TURNED AWAY NOT BECAUSE HE FELT IT HARD AND SAD PRINCESS MARY ANDNATSHA UNDERSTOOD THAT BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THATWAS REQUIRED OF HIM BUT WHEN THEY TOLD HIM TO BLESS THE BOY HE DIDWHAT WAS DEMANDED AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF ASKING WHETHER THERE WASANYTHING ELSE HE SHOULD DOWHEN THE LAST CONVULSIONS OF THE BODY WHICH THE SPIRIT WAS LEAVINGOCCURRED PRINCESS MARY AND NATSHA WERE PRESENTIS IT OVER SAID PRINCESS MARY WHEN HIS BODY HAD FOR A FEW MINUTESLAIN MOTIONLESS GROWING COLD BEFORE THEM NATSHA WENT UP LOOKED ATTHE DEAD EYES AND HASTENED TO CLOSE THEM SHE CLOSED THEM BUT DID NOTKISS THEM BUT CLUNG TO THAT WHICH REMINDED HER MOST NEARLY OF HIMHISBODYWHERE HAS HE GONE WHERE IS HE NOWWHEN THE BODY WASHED AND DRESSED LAY IN THE COFFIN ON A TABLEEVERYONE CAME TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIM AND THEY ALL WEPTLITTLE NICHOLAS CRIED BECAUSE HIS HEART WAS RENT BY PAINFUL PERPLEXITYTHE COUNTESS AND SNYA CRIED FROM PITY FOR NATSHA AND BECAUSE HE WASNO MORE THE OLD COUNT CRIED BECAUSE HE FELT THAT BEFORE LONG HE TOOMUST TAKE THE SAME TERRIBLE STEPNATSHA AND PRINCESS MARY ALSO WEPT NOW BUT NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWNPERSONAL GRIEF THEY WEPT WITH A REVERENT AND SOFTENING EMOTION WHICHHAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEIR SOULS AT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESIMPLE AND SOLEMN MYSTERY OF DEATH THAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THEIRPRESENCEBOOK THIRTEEN CHAPTER IMANS MIND CANNOT GRASP THE CAUSES OF EVENTS IN THEIR COMPLETENESS BUTTHE DESIRE TO FIND THOSE CAUSES IS IMPLANTED IN MANS SOUL AND WITHOUTCONSIDERING THE MULTIPLICITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONDITIONS ANY ONEOF WHICH TAKEN SEPARATELY MAY SEEM TO BE THE CAUSE HE SNATCHES AT THEFIRST APPROXIMATION TO A CAUSE THAT SEEMS TO HIM INTELLIGIBLE AND SAYSTHIS IS THE CAUSE IN HISTORICAL EVENTS WHERE THE ACTIONS OF MEN ARETHE SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION THE FIRST AND MOST PRIMITIVE APPROXIMATIONTO PRESENT ITSELF WAS THE WILL OF THE GODS AND AFTER THAT THE WILL OFTHOSE WHO STOOD IN THE MOST PROMINENT POSITIONTHE HEROES OF HISTORYBUT WE NEED ONLY PENETRATE TO THE ESSENCE OF ANY HISTORIC EVENTWHICHLIES IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE GENERAL MASS OF MEN WHO TAKE PART IN ITTOBE CONVINCED THAT THE WILL OF THE HISTORIC HERO DOES NOT CONTROL THEACTIONS OF THE MASS BUT IS ITSELF CONTINUALLY CONTROLLED IT MAY SEEMTO BE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE WHETHER WE UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OFHISTORICAL EVENTS THIS WAY OR THAT YET THERE IS THE SAME DIFFERENCEBETWEEN A MAN WHO SAYS THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST MOVED ON THE EASTBECAUSE NAPOLEON WISHED IT AND A MAN WHO SAYS THAT THIS HAPPENED BECAUSEIT HAD TO HAPPEN AS THERE IS BETWEEN THOSE WHO DECLARED THAT THEEARTH WAS STATIONARY AND THAT THE PLANETS MOVED ROUND IT AND THOSE WHOADMITTED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT UPHELD THE EARTH BUT KNEW THEREWERE LAWS DIRECTING ITS MOVEMENT AND THAT OF THE OTHER PLANETS THEREIS AND CAN BE NO CAUSE OF AN HISTORICAL EVENT EXCEPT THE ONE CAUSE OFALL CAUSES BUT THERE ARE LAWS DIRECTING EVENTS AND SOME OF THESE LAWSARE KNOWN TO US WHILE WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF OTHERS WE CANNOT COMPREHENDTHE DISCOVERY OF THESE LAWS IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE QUITEABANDONED THE ATTEMPT TO FIND THE CAUSE IN THE WILL OF SOME ONE MANJUST AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAWS OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS WASPOSSIBLE ONLY WHEN MEN ABANDONED THE CONCEPTION OF THE FIXITY OF THEEARTHTHE HISTORIANS CONSIDER THAT NEXT TO THE BATTLE OF BORODIN AND THEOCCUPATION OF MOSCOW BY THE ENEMY AND ITS DESTRUCTION BY FIRE THE MOSTIMPORTANT EPISODE OF THE WAR OF  WAS THE MOVEMENT OF THE RUSSIANARMY FROM THE RYAZNA TO THE KALGA ROAD AND TO THE TARTINO CAMPTHESOCALLED FLANK MARCH ACROSS THE KRSNAYA PAKHR RIVER THEY ASCRIBE THEGLORY OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT OF GENIUS TO DIFFERENT MEN AND DISPUTE AS TOWHOM THE HONOR IS DUE EVEN FOREIGN HISTORIANS INCLUDING THE FRENCHACKNOWLEDGE THE GENIUS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS WHEN THEY SPEAK OFTHAT FLANK MARCH BUT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY MILITARY WRITERSAND FOLLOWING THEM OTHERS CONSIDER THIS FLANK MARCH TO BE THE PROFOUNDCONCEPTION OF SOME ONE MAN WHO SAVED RUSSIA AND DESTROYED NAPOLEON INTHE FIRST PLACE IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PROFUNDITY AND GENIUSOF THIS MOVEMENT LAY FOR NOT MUCH MENTAL EFFORT WAS NEEDED TO SEE THATTHE BEST POSITION FOR AN ARMY WHEN IT IS NOT BEING ATTACKED IS WHERETHERE ARE MOST PROVISIONS AND EVEN A DULL BOY OF THIRTEEN COULD HAVEGUESSED THAT THE BEST POSITION FOR AN ARMY AFTER ITS RETREAT FROM MOSCOWIN  WAS ON THE KALGA ROAD SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND BYWHAT REASONING THE HISTORIANS REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS MANEUVERWAS A PROFOUND ONE AND IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND JUST WHYTHEY THINK THAT THIS MANEUVER WAS CALCULATED TO SAVE RUSSIA AND DESTROYTHE FRENCH FOR THIS FLANK MARCH HAD IT BEEN PRECEDED ACCOMPANIEDOR FOLLOWED BY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE PROVED RUINOUS TO THERUSSIANS AND SALUTARY FOR THE FRENCH IF THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANARMY REALLY BEGAN TO IMPROVE FROM THE TIME OF THAT MARCH IT DOES NOT ATALL FOLLOW THAT THE MARCH WAS THE CAUSE OF ITTHAT FLANK MARCH MIGHT NOT ONLY HAVE FAILED TO GIVE ANY ADVANTAGE TOTHE RUSSIAN ARMY BUT MIGHT IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE LED TO ITSDESTRUCTION WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD MOSCOW NOT BURNED DOWN IFMURAT HAD NOT LOST SIGHT OF THE RUSSIANS IF NAPOLEON HAD NOT REMAINEDINACTIVE IF THE RUSSIAN ARMY AT KRSNAYA PAKHR HAD GIVEN BATTLE ASBENNIGSEN AND BARCLAY ADVISED WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THE FRENCHATTACKED THE RUSSIANS WHILE THEY WERE MARCHING BEYOND THE PAKHR WHATWOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF ON APPROACHING TARTINO NAPOLEON HAD ATTACKEDTHE RUSSIANS WITH BUT A TENTH OF THE ENERGY HE HAD SHOWN WHEN HEATTACKED THEM AT SMOLNSK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THE FRENCH MOVEDON PETERSBURG IN ANY OF THESE EVENTUALITIES THE FLANK MARCH THATBROUGHT SALVATION MIGHT HAVE PROVED DISASTROUSTHE THIRD AND MOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT PEOPLE STUDYINGHISTORY DELIBERATELY AVOID SEEING THAT THIS FLANK MARCH CANNOT BEATTRIBUTED TO ANY ONE MAN THAT NO ONE EVER FORESAW IT AND THAT INREALITY LIKE THE RETREAT FROM FIL IT DID NOT SUGGEST ITSELF TO ANYONEIN ITS ENTIRETY BUT RESULTEDMOMENT BY MOMENT STEP BY STEP EVENT BYEVENTFROM AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF MOST DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WAS ONLYSEEN IN ITS ENTIRETY WHEN IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND BELONGED TO THEPASTAT THE COUNCIL AT FIL THE PREVAILING THOUGHT IN THE MINDS OF THERUSSIAN COMMANDERS WAS THE ONE NATURALLY SUGGESTING ITSELF NAMELY ADIRECT RETREAT BY THE NZHNI ROAD IN PROOF OF THIS THERE IS THE FACTTHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL VOTED FOR SUCH A RETREAT AND ABOVEALL THERE IS THE WELLKNOWN CONVERSATION AFTER THE COUNCIL BETWEEN THECOMMANDER IN CHIEF AND LANSKY WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE COMMISSARIATDEPARTMENT LANSKY INFORMED THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAT THE ARMYSUPPLIES WERE FOR THE MOST PART STORED ALONG THE OK IN THE TLA ANDRYAZN PROVINCES AND THAT IF THEY RETREATED ON NZHNI THE ARMY WOULDBE SEPARATED FROM ITS SUPPLIES BY THE BROAD RIVER OK WHICH CANNOT BECROSSED EARLY IN WINTER THIS WAS THE FIRST INDICATION OF THE NECESSITYOF DEVIATING FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEMED THE MOST NATURAL COURSEADIRECT RETREAT ON NZHNINVGOROD THE ARMY TURNED MORE TO THE SOUTHALONG THE RYAZN ROAD AND NEARER TO ITS SUPPLIES SUBSEQUENTLY THEINACTIVITY OF THE FRENCH WHO EVEN LOST SIGHT OF THE RUSSIAN ARMYCONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF THE ARSENAL AT TLA AND ESPECIALLY THEADVANTAGES OF DRAWING NEARER TO ITS SUPPLIES CAUSED THE ARMY TO TURNSTILL FURTHER SOUTH TO THE TLA ROAD HAVING CROSSED OVER BY A FORCEDMARCH TO THE TLA ROAD BEYOND THE PAKHR THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERSINTENDED TO REMAIN AT PODLSK AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF THE TARTINOPOSITION BUT INNUMERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE REAPPEARANCE OF FRENCHTROOPS WHO HAD FOR A TIME LOST TOUCH WITH THE RUSSIANS AND PROJECTSOF GIVING BATTLE AND ABOVE ALL THE ABUNDANCE OF PROVISIONS IN KALGAPROVINCE OBLIGED OUR ARMY TO TURN STILL MORE TO THE SOUTH AND TO CROSSFROM THE TLA TO THE KALGA ROAD AND GO TO TARTINO WHICH WAS BETWEENTHE ROADS ALONG WHICH THOSE SUPPLIES LAY JUST AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TOSAY WHEN IT WAS DECIDED TO ABANDON MOSCOW SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAYPRECISELY WHEN OR BY WHOM IT WAS DECIDED TO MOVE TO TARTINO ONLYWHEN THE ARMY HAD GOT THERE AS THE RESULT OF INNUMERABLE AND VARYINGFORCES DID PEOPLE BEGIN TO ASSURE THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAD DESIRED THISMOVEMENT AND LONG AGO FORESEEN ITS RESULTCHAPTER IITHE FAMOUS FLANK MOVEMENT MERELY CONSISTED IN THIS AFTER THE ADVANCEOF THE FRENCH HAD CEASED THE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH HAD BEEN CONTINUALLYRETREATING STRAIGHT BACK FROM THE INVADERS DEVIATED FROM THAT DIRECTCOURSE AND NOT FINDING ITSELF PURSUED WAS NATURALLY DRAWN TOWARD THEDISTRICT WHERE SUPPLIES WERE ABUNDANTIF INSTEAD OF IMAGINING TO OURSELVES COMMANDERS OF GENIUS LEADING THERUSSIAN ARMY WE PICTURE THAT ARMY WITHOUT ANY LEADERS IT COULD NOTHAVE DONE ANYTHING BUT MAKE A RETURN MOVEMENT TOWARD MOSCOW DESCRIBINGAN ARC IN THE DIRECTION WHERE MOST PROVISIONS WERE TO BE FOUND AND WHERETHE COUNTRY WAS RICHESTTHAT MOVEMENT FROM THE NZHNI TO THE RYAZN TLA AND KALGA ROADS WASSO NATURAL THAT EVEN THE RUSSIAN MARAUDERS MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION ANDDEMANDS WERE SENT FROM PETERSBURG FOR KUTZOV TO TAKE HIS ARMY THATWAY AT TARTINO KUTZOV RECEIVED WHAT WAS ALMOST A REPRIMAND FROMTHE EMPEROR FOR HAVING

DIRECTION OF ANY ONE FORCEIF MANY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND VARIOUSLY DIRECTED FORCES ACT ON A GIVENBODY THE DIRECTION OF ITS MOTION CANNOT COINCIDE WITH ANY ONE OF THOSEFORCES BUT WILL ALWAYS BE A MEANWHAT IN MECHANICS IS REPRESENTED BYTHE DIAGONAL OF A PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCESIF IN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN BY HISTORIANS ESPECIALLY FRENCH ONES WEFIND THEIR WARS AND BATTLES CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUSLYFORMED PLANS THE ONLY CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN IS THAT THOSE DESCRIPTIONSARE FALSETHE BATTLE OF TARTINO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT ATTAIN THE AIM TOLL HAD INVIEWTO LEAD THE TROOPS INTO ACTION IN THE ORDER PRESCRIBED BY THEDISPOSITIONS NOR THAT WHICH COUNT ORLVDENSOV MAY HAVE HAD IN VIEWTOTAKE MURAT PRISONER NOR THE RESULT OF IMMEDIATELY DESTROYING THE WHOLECORPS WHICH BENNIGSEN AND OTHERS MAY HAVE HAD IN VIEW NOR THE AIM OFTHE OFFICER WHO WISHED TO GO INTO ACTION TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF NORTHAT OF THE COSSACK WHO WANTED MORE BOOTY THAN HE GOT AND SO ON BUTIF THE AIM OF THE BATTLE WAS WHAT ACTUALLY RESULTED AND WHAT ALL THERUSSIANS OF THAT DAY DESIREDTO DRIVE THE FRENCH OUT OF RUSSIA ANDDESTROY THEIR ARMYIT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BATTLE OF TARTINO JUSTBECAUSE OF ITS INCONGRUITIES WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS WANTED AT THAT STAGEOF THE CAMPAIGN IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND EVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINEANY RESULT MORE OPPORTUNE THAN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THIS BATTLE WITHA MINIMUM OF EFFORT AND INSIGNIFICANT LOSSES DESPITE THE GREATESTCONFUSION THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS OF THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN WEREATTAINED THE TRANSITION FROM RETREAT TO ADVANCE AN EXPOSURE OF THEWEAKNESS OF THE FRENCH AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT SHOCK WHICHNAPOLEONS ARMY HAD ONLY AWAITED TO BEGIN ITS FLIGHTCHAPTER VIIINAPOLEON ENTERS MOSCOW AFTER THE BRILLIANT VICTORY DE LA MOSKOWA THERECAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE VICTORY FOR THE BATTLEFIELD REMAINS IN THEHANDS OF THE FRENCH THE RUSSIANS RETREAT AND ABANDON THEIR ANCIENTCAPITAL MOSCOW ABOUNDING IN PROVISIONS ARMS MUNITIONS ANDINCALCULABLE WEALTH IS IN NAPOLEONS HANDS THE RUSSIAN ARMY ONLY HALFTHE STRENGTH OF THE FRENCH DOES NOT MAKE A SINGLE ATTEMPT TO ATTACK FORA WHOLE MONTH NAPOLEONS POSITION IS MOST BRILLIANT HE CAN EITHER FALLON THE RUSSIAN ARMY WITH DOUBLE ITS STRENGTH AND DESTROY IT NEGOTIATEAN ADVANTAGEOUS PEACE OR IN CASE OF A REFUSAL MAKE A MENACING MOVE ONPETERSBURG OR EVEN IN THE CASE OF A REVERSE RETURN TO SMOLNSK ORVLNA OR REMAIN IN MOSCOW IN SHORT NO SPECIAL GENIUS WOULD SEEM TO BEREQUIRED TO RETAIN THE BRILLIANT POSITION THE FRENCH HELD AT THAT TIMEFOR THAT ONLY VERY SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS WERE NECESSARY NOT TO ALLOWTHE TROOPS TO LOOT TO PREPARE WINTER CLOTHINGOF WHICH THERE WASSUFFICIENT IN MOSCOW FOR THE WHOLE ARMYAND METHODICALLY TO COLLECT THEPROVISIONS OF WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FRENCH HISTORIANS THERE WEREENOUGH IN MOSCOW TO SUPPLY THE WHOLE ARMY FOR SIX MONTHS YET NAPOLEONTHAT GREATEST OF ALL GENIUSES WHO THE HISTORIANS DECLARE HAD CONTROL OFTHE ARMY TOOK NONE OF THESE STEPSHE NOT MERELY DID NOTHING OF THE KIND BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE USED HISPOWER TO SELECT THE MOST FOOLISH AND RUINOUS OF ALL THE COURSES OPENTO HIM OF ALL THAT NAPOLEON MIGHT HAVE DONE WINTERING IN MOSCOWADVANCING ON PETERSBURG OR ON NZHNINVGOROD OR RETIRING BY A MORENORTHERLY OR MORE SOUTHERLY ROUTE SAY BY THE ROAD KUTZOV AFTERWARDSTOOK NOTHING MORE STUPID OR DISASTROUS CAN BE IMAGINED THAN WHAT HEACTUALLY DID HE REMAINED IN MOSCOW TILL OCTOBER LETTING THE TROOPSPLUNDER THE CITY THEN HESITATING WHETHER TO LEAVE A GARRISON BEHINDHIM HE QUITTED MOSCOW APPROACHED KUTZOV WITHOUT JOINING BATTLETURNED TO THE RIGHT AND REACHED MLOYAROSLVETS AGAIN WITHOUTATTEMPTING TO BREAK THROUGH AND TAKE THE ROAD KUTZOV TOOK BUT RETIRINGINSTEAD TO MOZHYSK ALONG THE DEVASTATED SMOLNSK ROAD NOTHING MORESTUPID THAN THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DEVISED OR MORE DISASTROUS FOR THEARMY AS THE SEQUEL SHOWED HAD NAPOLEONS AIM BEEN TO DESTROY HIS ARMYTHE MOST SKILLFUL STRATEGIST COULD HARDLY HAVE DEVISED ANY SERIESOF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SO COMPLETELY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT PURPOSEINDEPENDENTLY OF ANYTHING THE RUSSIAN ARMY MIGHT DONAPOLEON THE MAN OF GENIUS DID THIS BUT TO SAY THAT HE DESTROYED HISARMY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO OR BECAUSE HE WAS VERY STUPID WOULD BE ASUNJUST AS TO SAY THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TROOPS TO MOSCOW BECAUSE HEWISHED TO AND BECAUSE HE WAS VERY CLEVER AND A GENIUSIN BOTH CASES HIS PERSONAL ACTIVITY HAVING NO MORE FORCE THAN THEPERSONAL ACTIVITY OF ANY SOLDIER MERELY COINCIDED WITH THE LAWS THATGUIDED THE EVENTTHE HISTORIANS QUITE FALSELY REPRESENT NAPOLEONS FACULTIES AS HAVINGWEAKENED IN MOSCOW AND DO SO ONLY BECAUSE THE RESULTS DID NOT JUSTIFYHIS ACTIONS HE EMPLOYED ALL HIS ABILITY AND STRENGTH TO DO THE BEST HECOULD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ARMY AS HE HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY AND AS HE DIDSUBSEQUENTLY IN  HIS ACTIVITY AT THAT TIME WAS NO LESS ASTOUNDINGTHAN IT WAS IN EGYPT IN ITALY IN AUSTRIA AND IN PRUSSIA WE DO NOTKNOW FOR CERTAIN IN HOW FAR HIS GENIUS WAS GENUINE IN EGYPTWHERE FORTYCENTURIES LOOKED DOWN UPON HIS GRANDEURFOR HIS GREAT EXPLOITS THERE AREALL TOLD US BY FRENCHMEN WE CANNOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE HIS GENIUS INAUSTRIA OR PRUSSIA FOR WE HAVE TO DRAW OUR INFORMATION FROM FRENCHOR GERMAN SOURCES AND THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE SURRENDER OF WHOLE CORPSWITHOUT FIGHTING AND OF FORTRESSES WITHOUT A SIEGE MUST INCLINE GERMANSTO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUS AS THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THE WAR CARRIED ONIN GERMANY BUT WE THANK GOD HAVE NO NEED TO RECOGNIZE HIS GENIUSIN ORDER TO HIDE OUR SHAME WE HAVE PAID FOR THE RIGHT TO LOOK AT THEMATTER PLAINLY AND SIMPLY AND WE WILL NOT ABANDON THAT RIGHTHIS ACTIVITY IN MOSCOW WAS

DAYS OF OCTOBER ANOTHER ENVOY CAME TO KUTZOV WITH A LETTERFROM NAPOLEON PROPOSING PEACE AND FALSELY DATED FROM MOSCOW THOUGHNAPOLEON WAS ALREADY NOT FAR FROM KUTZOV ON THE OLD KALGA ROADKUTZOV REPLIED TO THIS LETTER AS HE HAD DONE TO THE ONE FORMERLYBROUGHT BY LAURISTON SAYING THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF PEACESOON AFTER THAT A REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM DROKHOVS GUERRILLADETACHMENT OPERATING TO THE LEFT OF TARTINO THAT TROOPS OF BROUSSIERSDIVISION HAD BEEN SEEN AT FORMNSK AND THAT BEING SEPARATED FROM THEREST OF THE FRENCH ARMY THEY MIGHT EASILY BE DESTROYED THE SOLDIERS ANDOFFICERS AGAIN DEMANDED ACTION GENERALS ON THE STAFF EXCITED BY THEMEMORY OF THE EASY VICTORY AT TARTINO URGED KUTZOV TO CARRY OUTDROKHOVS SUGGESTION KUTZOV DID NOT CONSIDER ANY OFFENSIVE NECESSARYTHE RESULT WAS A COMPROMISE WHICH WAS INEVITABLE A SMALL DETACHMENT WASSENT TO FORMNSK TO ATTACK BROUSSIERBY A STRANGE COINCIDENCE THIS TASK WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A MOSTDIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT ONE WAS ENTRUSTED TO DOKHTROVTHAT SAME MODESTLITTLE DOKHTROV WHOM NO ONE HAD DESCRIBED TO US AS DRAWING UP PLANSOF BATTLES DASHING ABOUT IN FRONT OF REGIMENTS SHOWERING CROSSES ONBATTERIES AND SO ON AND WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE AND WAS SPOKEN OF ASUNDECIDED AND UNDISCERNINGBUT WHOM WE FIND COMMANDING WHEREVER THEPOSITION WAS MOST DIFFICULT ALL THROUGH THE RUSSOFRENCH WARS FROMAUSTERLITZ TO THE YEAR  AT AUSTERLITZ HE REMAINED LAST AT THEAUGEZD DAM RALLYING THE REGIMENTS SAVING WHAT WAS POSSIBLE WHEN ALLWERE FLYING AND PERISHING AND NOT A SINGLE GENERAL WAS LEFT IN THE REARGUARD ILL WITH FEVER HE WENT TO SMOLNSK WITH TWENTY THOUSAND MENTO DEFEND THE TOWN AGAINST NAPOLEONS WHOLE ARMY IN SMOLNSK AT THEMALKHOV GATE HE HAD HARDLY DOZED OFF IN A PAROXYSM OF FEVER BEFORE HEWAS AWAKENED BY THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE TOWNAND SMOLNSK HELD OUT ALLDAY LONG AT THE BATTLE OF BORODIN WHEN BAGRATIN WAS KILLED AND NINETENTHS OF THE MEN OF OUR LEFT FLANK HAD FALLEN AND THE FULL FORCE OF THEFRENCH ARTILLERY FIRE WAS DIRECTED AGAINST IT THE MAN SENT THERE WASTHIS SAME IRRESOLUTE AND UNDISCERNING DOKHTROVKUTZOV HASTENING TORECTIFY A MISTAKE HE HAD MADE BY SENDING SOMEONE ELSE THERE FIRSTAND THE QUIET LITTLE DOKHTROV RODE THITHER AND BORODIN BECAME THEGREATEST GLORY OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY MANY HEROES HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED TOUS IN VERSE AND PROSE BUT OF DOKHTROV SCARCELY A WORD HAS BEEN SAIDIT WAS DOKHTROV AGAIN WHOM THEY SENT TO FORMNSK AND FROM THERE TOMLOYAROSLVETS THE PLACE WHERE THE LAST BATTLE WITH THE FRENCH WASFOUGHT AND WHERE THE OBVIOUS DISINTEGRATION OF THE FRENCH ARMY BEGANAND WE ARE TOLD OF MANY GENIUSES AND HEROES OF THAT PERIOD OF THECAMPAIGN BUT OF DOKHTROV NOTHING OR VERY LITTLE IS SAID AND THATDUBIOUSLY AND THIS SILENCE ABOUT DOKHTROV IS THE CLEAREST TESTIMONY TOHIS MERITIT IS NATURAL FOR A MAN WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORKINGS OF AMACHINE TO IMAGINE THAT A SHAVING THAT HAS FALLEN INTO IT BY CHANCEAND IS INTERFERING WITH ITS ACTION AND TOSSING ABOUT IN IT IS ITS MOSTIMPORTANT PART THE MAN WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRUCTION OFTHE MACHINE CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT THE SMALL CONNECTING COGWHEEL WHICHREVOLVES QUIETLY IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE MACHINE ANDNOT THE SHAVING WHICH MERELY HARMS AND HINDERS THE WORKINGON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER WHEN DOKHTROV HAD GONE HALFWAY TO FORMNSK ANDSTOPPED AT THE VILLAGE OF ARISTVO PREPARING FAITHFULLY TO

NOW WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO HE HADBEEN ORDERED TO ATTACK FORMNSK BUT ONLY BROUSSIER HAD BEEN THERE ATTHAT TIME AND NOW THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY WAS THERE ERMLOV WISHED TO ACTON HIS OWN JUDGMENT BUT DOKHTROV

BROUGHT WAS OF GREATIMPORTANCE AND THAT NO TIME MUST BE LOST HE DID NOT CONSIDER OR ASKHIMSELF WHETHER THE NEWS WAS GOOD OR BAD THAT DID NOT INTEREST HIM HEREGARDED THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF THE WAR NOT WITH HIS INTELLIGENCE OR HISREASON BUT BY SOMETHING ELSE THERE WAS WITHIN HIM A DEEP UNEXPRESSEDCONVICTION THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL BUT THAT ONE MUST NOT TRUST TO THISAND STILL LESS SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT MUST ONLY ATTEND TO ONES OWN WORKAND HE DID HIS WORK GIVING HIS WHOLE STRENGTH TO THE TASKPETER PETRVICH KONOVNTSYN LIKE DOKHTROV SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN INCLUDEDMERELY FOR PROPRIETYS SAKE IN THE LIST OF THE SOCALLED HEROES OFTHE BARCLAYS RAVSKIS ERMLOVS PLTOVS AND MILORDOVICHES LIKEDOKHTROV HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A MAN OF VERY LIMITED CAPACITYAND INFORMATION AND LIKE DOKHTROV HE NEVER MADE PLANS OF BATTLE BUTWAS ALWAYS FOUND WHERE THE SITUATION WAS MOST DIFFICULT SINCE HISAPPOINTMENT AS GENERAL ON DUTY HE HAD ALWAYS SLEPT WITH HIS DOOR OPENGIVING ORDERS THAT EVERY MESSENGER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WAKE HIM UP INBATTLE HE WAS ALWAYS UNDER FIRE SO THAT KUTZOV REPROVED HIM FOR IT ANDFEARED TO SEND HIM TO THE FRONT AND LIKE DOKHTROV HE WAS ONE OF THOSEUNNOTICED COGWHEELS THAT WITHOUT CLATTER OR NOISE CONSTITUTE THE MOSTESSENTIAL PART OF THE MACHINECOMING OUT OF THE HUT INTO THE DAMP DARK NIGHT KONOVNTSYNFROWNEDPARTLY FROM AN INCREASED PAIN IN HIS HEAD AND PARTLY AT THEUNPLEASANT THOUGHT THAT OCCURRED TO HIM OF HOW ALL THAT NEST OFINFLUENTIAL MEN ON THE STAFF WOULD BE STIRRED UP BY THIS NEWSESPECIALLY BENNIGSEN WHO EVER SINCE TARTINO HAD BEEN AT DAGGERSDRAWN WITH KUTZOV AND HOW THEY WOULD MAKE SUGGESTIONS QUARREL ISSUEORDERS AND RESCIND THEM AND THIS PREMONITION WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HIMTHOUGH HE KNEW IT COULD NOT BE HELPEDAND IN FACT TOLL TO WHOM HE WENT TO COMMUNICATE THE NEWS IMMEDIATELYBEGAN TO EXPOUND HIS PLANS TO A GENERAL SHARING HIS QUARTERS UNTILKONOVNTSYN WHO LISTENED IN WEARY SILENCE REMINDED HIM THAT THEY MUSTGO TO SEE HIS HIGHNESSCHAPTER XVIIKUTZOV LIKE ALL OLD PEOPLE DID NOT SLEEP MUCH AT NIGHT HE OFTEN FELLASLEEP UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DAYTIME BUT AT NIGHT LYING ON HIS BEDWITHOUT UNDRESSING HE GENERALLY REMAINED AWAKE THINKINGSO HE LAY NOW ON HIS BED SUPPORTING HIS LARGE HEAVY SCARRED HEAD ONHIS PLUMP HAND WITH HIS ONE EYE OPEN MEDITATING AND PEERING INTO THEDARKNESSSINCE BENNIGSEN WHO CORRESPONDED WITH THE EMPEROR AND HAD MOREINFLUENCE THAN ANYONE ELSE ON THE STAFF HAD BEGUN TO AVOID HIM KUTZOVWAS MORE AT EASE AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HIMSELF AND HIS TROOPS BEINGOBLIGED TO TAKE PART IN USELESS AGGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS THE LESSON OF THETARTINO BATTLE AND OF THE DAY BEFORE IT WHICH KUTZOV REMEMBERED WITHPAIN MUST HE THOUGHT HAVE SOME EFFECT ON OTHERS TOOTHEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN ONLY LOSE BY TAKING THE OFFENSIVEPATIENCE AND TIME ARE MY WARRIORS MY CHAMPIONS THOUGHT KUTZOV HEKNEW THAT AN APPLE SHOULD NOT BE PLUCKED WHILE IT IS GREEN IT WILL FALLOF ITSELF WHEN RIPE BUT IF PICKED UNRIPE THE APPLE IS SPOILED THE TREEIS HARMED AND YOUR TEETH ARE SET ON EDGE LIKE AN EXPERIENCED SPORTSMANHE KNEW THAT THE BEAST WAS WOUNDED AND WOUNDED AS ONLY THE WHOLESTRENGTH OF RUSSIA COULD HAVE WOUNDED IT BUT WHETHER IT WAS MORTALLYWOUNDED OR NOT WAS STILL AN UNDECIDED QUESTION NOW BY THE FACT OFLAURISTON AND BARTHLEMI HAVING BEEN SENT AND BY THE REPORTS OF THEGUERRILLAS KUTZOV WAS ALMOST SURE THAT THE WOUND WAS MORTAL BUT HENEEDED FURTHER PROOFS AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO WAITTHEY WANT TO RUN TO SEE HOW THEY HAVE WOUNDED IT WAIT AND WE SHALLSEE CONTINUAL MANEUVERS CONTINUAL ADVANCES THOUGHT HE WHAT FORONLY TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES AS IF FIGHTING WERE FUN THEY ARELIKE CHILDREN FROM WHOM ONE CANT GET ANY SENSIBLE ACCOUNT OF WHAT HASHAPPENED BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT TO SHOW HOW WELL THEY CAN FIGHT BUTTHATS NOT WHAT IS NEEDED NOWAND WHAT INGENIOUS MANEUVERS THEY ALL PROPOSE TO ME IT SEEMS TOTHEM THAT WHEN THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF TWO OR THREE CONTINGENCIES HEREMEMBERED THE GENERAL PLAN SENT HIM FROM PETERSBURG THEY HAVEFORESEEN EVERYTHING BUT THE CONTINGENCIES ARE ENDLESSTHE UNDECIDED QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE WOUND INFLICTED AT BORODIN WASMORTAL OR NOT HAD HUNG OVER KUTZOVS HEAD FOR A WHOLE MONTH ON THE ONEHAND THE FRENCH HAD OCCUPIED MOSCOW ON THE OTHER KUTZOV FELT ASSUREDWITH ALL HIS BEING THAT THE TERRIBLE BLOW INTO WHICH HE AND ALL THERUSSIANS HAD PUT THEIR WHOLE STRENGTH MUST HAVE BEEN MORTAL BUT IN ANYCASE PROOFS WERE NEEDED HE HAD WAITED A WHOLE MONTH FOR THEM AND GREWMORE IMPATIENT THE LONGER HE WAITED LYING ON HIS BED DURING THOSESLEEPLESS NIGHTS HE DID JUST WHAT HE REPROACHED THOSE YOUNGER GENERALSFOR DOING HE IMAGINED ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES JUST LIKETHE YOUNGER MEN BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HE SAW THOUSANDS OFCONTINGENCIES INSTEAD OF TWO OR THREE AND BASED NOTHING ON THEM THELONGER HE THOUGHT THE MORE CONTINGENCIES PRESENTED THEMSELVES HEIMAGINED ALL SORTS OF MOVEMENTS OF THE NAPOLEONIC ARMY AS A WHOLE ORIN SECTIONSAGAINST PETERSBURG OR AGAINST HIM OR TO OUTFLANK HIMHE THOUGHT TOO OF THE POSSIBILITY WHICH HE FEARED MOST OF ALL THATNAPOLEON MIGHT FIGHT HIM WITH HIS OWN WEAPON AND REMAIN IN MOSCOWAWAITING HIM KUTZOV EVEN IMAGINED THAT NAPOLEONS ARMY MIGHT TURN BACKTHROUGH MEDN AND YUKHNV BUT THE ONE THING HE COULD NOT FORESEE WASWHAT HAPPENEDTHE INSANE CONVULSIVE STAMPEDE OF NAPOLEONS ARMY DURINGITS FIRST ELEVEN DAYS AFTER LEAVING MOSCOW A STAMPEDE WHICH MADEPOSSIBLE WHAT KUTZOV HAD NOT YET EVEN DARED TO THINK OFTHE COMPLETEEXTERMINATION OF THE FRENCH DROKHOVS REPORT ABOUT BROUSSIERSDIVISION THE GUERRILLAS REPORTS OF DISTRESS IN NAPOLEONS ARMY RUMORSOF PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING MOSCOW ALL CONFIRMED THE SUPPOSITION THATTHE FRENCH ARMY WAS BEATEN AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT BUT THESE WEREONLY SUPPOSITIONS WHICH SEEMED IMPORTANT TO THE YOUNGER MEN BUT NOT TOKUTZOV WITH HIS SIXTY YEARS EXPERIENCE HE KNEW WHAT VALUE TO ATTACHTO RUMORS KNEW HOW APT PEOPLE WHO DESIRE ANYTHING ARE TO GROUP ALL NEWSSO THAT IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM WHAT THEY DESIRE AND HE KNEW HOW READILYIN SUCH CASES THEY OMIT ALL THAT MAKES FOR THE CONTRARY AND THE MOREHE DESIRED IT THE LESS HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BELIEVE IT THIS QUESTIONABSORBED ALL HIS MENTAL POWERS ALL ELSE WAS TO HIM ONLY LIFESCUSTOMARY ROUTINE TO SUCH CUSTOMARY ROUTINE BELONGED HIS CONVERSATIONSWITH THE STAFF THE LETTERS HE WROTE FROM TARTINO TO MADAME DE STALTHE READING OF NOVELS THE DISTRIBUTION OF AWARDS HIS CORRESPONDENCEWITH PETERSBURG AND SO ON BUT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FRENCH WHICH HEALONE FORESAW WAS HIS HEARTS ONE DESIREON THE NIGHT OF THE ELEVENTH OF OCTOBER HE LAY

SOMETHING BUT KUTZOV CHECKEDHIM HE TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING BUT HIS FACE SUDDENLY PUCKERED ANDWRINKLED HE WAVED HIS ARM AT TOLL AND TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OFTHE ROOM TO THE CORNER DARKENED BY THE ICONS THAT HUNG THEREO LORD MY CREATOR THOU HAS HEARD OUR PRAYER SAID HE IN ATREMULOUS VOICE WITH FOLDED HANDS RUSSIA IS SAVED I THANK THEE OLORD AND HE WEPTCHAPTER XVIIIFROM THE TIME HE RECEIVED THIS NEWS TO THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN ALLKUTZOVS ACTIVITY WAS DIRECTED TOWARD RESTRAINING HIS TROOPS BYAUTHORITY BY GUILE AND BY ENTREATY FROM USELESS ATTACKSMANEUVERS OR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE PERISHING ENEMY DOKHTROV WENT TOMLOYAROSLVETS BUT KUTZOV LINGERED WITH THE MAIN ARMY AND GAVEORDERS FOR THE EVACUATION OF KALGAA RETREAT BEYOND WHICH TOWN SEEMEDTO HIM QUITE POSSIBLEEVERYWHERE KUTZOV RETREATED BUT THE ENEMY WITHOUT WAITING FOR HISRETREAT FLED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONNAPOLEONS HISTORIANS DESCRIBE TO US HIS SKILLED MANEUVERS AT TARTINOAND MLOYAROSLVETS AND MAKE CONJECTURES AS TO WHAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED HAD NAPOLEON BEEN IN TIME TO PENETRATE INTO THE RICH SOUTHERNPROVINCESBUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE FACT THAT NOTHING PREVENTED HIM FROM ADVANCINGINTO THOSE SOUTHERN PROVINCES FOR THE RUSSIAN ARMY DID NOT BAR HISWAY THE HISTORIANS FORGET THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE SAVED HIS ARMY FORTHEN ALREADY IT BORE WITHIN ITSELF THE GERMS OF INEVITABLE RUIN HOWCOULD THAT ARMYWHICH HAD FOUND ABUNDANT SUPPLIES IN MOSCOW AND HADTRAMPLED THEM UNDERFOOT INSTEAD OF KEEPING THEM AND ON ARRIVING ATSMOLNSK HAD LOOTED PROVISIONS INSTEAD OF STORING THEMHOW COULD THATARMY RECUPERATE IN KALGA PROVINCE WHICH WAS INHABITED BY RUSSIANS SUCHAS THOSE WHO LIVED IN MOSCOW AND WHERE FIRE HAD THE SAME PROPERTY OFCONSUMING WHAT WAS SET ABLAZETHAT ARMY COULD NOT RECOVER ANYWHERE SINCE THE BATTLE OF BORODINAND THE PILLAGE OF MOSCOW IT HAD BORNE WITHIN ITSELF AS IT WERE THECHEMICAL ELEMENTS OF DISSOLUTIONTHE MEMBERS OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN AN ARMYNAPOLEON HIMSELF AND ALL HISSOLDIERSFLED WITHOUT KNOWING WHITHER EACH CONCERNED ONLY TO MAKE HISESCAPE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FROM THIS POSITION OF THE HOPELESSNESS OFWHICH THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS VAGUELY CONSCIOUSSO IT CAME ABOUT THAT AT THE COUNCIL AT MLOYAROSLVETS WHEN THEGENERALS PRETENDING TO CONFER TOGETHER EXPRESSED VARIOUS OPINIONS ALLMOUTHS WERE CLOSED BY THE OPINION UTTERED BY THE SIMPLEMINDED SOLDIERMOUTON WHO SPEAKING LAST SAID WHAT THEY ALL FELT THAT THE ONE THINGNEEDFUL WAS TO GET AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND NO ONE NOTEVEN NAPOLEON COULD SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THAT TRUTH WHICH THEY ALLRECOGNIZEDBUT THOUGH THEY ALL REALIZED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO GET AWAY THERESTILL REMAINED A FEELING OF SHAME AT ADMITTING THAT THEY MUST FLEE ANEXTERNAL SHOCK WAS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THAT SHAME AND THIS SHOCK CAME INDUE TIME IT WAS WHAT THE FRENCH CALLED LE HOURRA DE LEMPEREURTHE DAY AFTER THE COUNCIL AT MLOYAROSLVETS NAPOLEON RODE OUT EARLY INTHE MORNING AMID THE LINES OF HIS ARMY WITH HIS SUITE OF MARSHALS ANDAN ESCORT ON THE PRETEXT OF INSPECTING THE ARMY AND THE SCENE OF THEPREVIOUS AND OF THE IMPENDING BATTLE SOME COSSACKS ON THE PROWL FORBOOTY FELL IN WITH THE EMPEROR AND VERY NEARLY CAPTURED HIM IF THECOSSACKS DID NOT CAPTURE NAPOLEON THEN WHAT SAVED HIM WAS THE VERYTHING THAT WAS DESTROYING THE FRENCH ARMY THE BOOTY ON WHICH THECOSSACKS FELL HERE AS AT TARTINO THEY WENT AFTER PLUNDER LEAVING THEMEN DISREGARDING NAPOLEON THEY RUSHED AFTER THE PLUNDER AND NAPOLEONMANAGED TO ESCAPEWHEN LES ENFANTS DU DON MIGHT SO EASILY HAVE TAKEN THE EMPEROR HIMSELFIN THE MIDST OF HIS ARMY IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUTTO FLY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE ALONG THE NEAREST FAMILIAR ROAD NAPOLEONWITH HIS FORTYYEAROLD STOMACH UNDERSTOOD THAT HINT NOT FEELING HISFORMER AGILITY AND BOLDNESS AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE FRIGHTTHE COSSACKS HAD GIVEN HIM HE AT ONCE AGREED WITH MOUTON AND ISSUEDORDERSAS THE HISTORIANS TELL USTO RETREAT BY THE SMOLNSK ROADTHAT NAPOLEON AGREED WITH MOUTON AND THAT THE ARMY RETREATED DOESNOT PROVE THAT NAPOLEON CAUSED IT TO RETREAT BUT THAT THE FORCES WHICHINFLUENCED THE WHOLE ARMY AND DIRECTED IT ALONG THE MOZHYSK THAT ISTHE SMOLNSK ROAD ACTED SIMULTANEOUSLY ON HIM ALSOCHAPTER XIXA MAN IN MOTION ALWAYS DEVISES AN AIM FOR THAT MOTION TO BE ABLE TO GOA THOUSAND MILES HE MUST IMAGINE THAT SOMETHING GOOD AWAITS HIM AT THEEND OF THOSE THOUSAND MILES ONE MUST HAVE THE PROSPECT OF A PROMISEDLAND TO HAVE THE STRENGTH TO MOVETHE PROMISED LAND FOR THE FRENCH DURING THEIR ADVANCE HAD BEEN MOSCOWDURING THEIR RETREAT IT WAS THEIR NATIVE LAND BUT THAT NATIVE LANDWAS TOO FAR OFF AND FOR A MAN GOING A THOUSAND MILES IT IS ABSOLUTELYNECESSARY TO SET ASIDE HIS FINAL GOAL AND TO SAY TO HIMSELF TODAY ISHALL GET TO A PLACE TWENTYFIVE MILES OFF WHERE I SHALL REST ANDSPEND THE NIGHT AND DURING THE FIRST DAYS JOURNEY THAT RESTING PLACEECLIPSES HIS ULTIMATE GOAL AND ATTRACTS ALL HIS HOPES AND DESIRES ANDTHE IMPULSES FELT BY A SINGLE PERSON ARE ALWAYS MAGNIFIED IN A CROWDFOR THE FRENCH RETREATING ALONG THE OLD SMOLNSK ROAD THE FINALGOALTHEIR NATIVE LANDWAS TOO REMOTE AND THEIR IMMEDIATE GOALWAS SMOLNSK TOWARD WHICH ALL THEIR DESIRES AND HOPES ENORMOUSLYINTENSIFIED IN THE MASS URGED THEM ON IT WAS NOT THAT THEY KNEW THATMUCH FOOD AND FRESH TROOPS AWAITED THEM IN SMOLNSK NOR THAT THEY WERETOLD SO ON THE CONTRARY THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS AND NAPOLEON HIMSELFKNEW THAT PROVISIONS WERE SCARCE THERE BUT BECAUSE THIS ALONE COULDGIVE THEM STRENGTH TO MOVE ON AND ENDURE THEIR PRESENT PRIVATIONS SOBOTH THOSE WHO KNEW AND THOSE WHO DID NOT KNOW DECEIVED THEMSELVES ANDPUSHED ON TO SMOLNSK AS TO A PROMISED LANDCOMING OUT ONTO THE HIGHROAD THE FRENCH FLED WITH SURPRISING ENERGYAND UNHEARDOF RAPIDITY TOWARD THE GOAL THEY HAD FIXED ON BESIDES THECOMMON IMPULSE WHICH BOUND THE WHOLE CROWD OF FRENCH INTO ONE MASS ANDSUPPLIED THEM WITH A CERTAIN ENERGY THERE WAS ANOTHER CAUSE BINDINGTHEM TOGETHERTHEIR GREAT NUMBERS AS WITH THE PHYSICAL LAW OF GRAVITYTHEIR ENORMOUS MASS DREW THE INDIVIDUAL HUMAN ATOMS TO ITSELF IN THEIRHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THEY MOVED LIKE A WHOLE NATIONEACH OF THEM DESIRED NOTHING MORE THAN TO GIVE HIMSELF UP AS A PRISONERTO ESCAPE FROM ALL THIS HORROR AND MISERY BUT ON THE ONE HAND THE FORCEOF THIS COMMON ATTRACTION TO SMOLNSK THEIR GOAL DREW EACH OF THEM INTHE SAME DIRECTION ON THE OTHER HAND AN ARMY CORPS COULD NOT SURRENDERTO A COMPANY AND THOUGH THE FRENCH AVAILED THEMSELVES OF EVERYCONVENIENT OPPORTUNITY TO DETACH THEMSELVES AND TO SURRENDER ON THESLIGHTEST DECENT PRETEXT SUCH PRETEXTS DID NOT ALWAYS OCCUR THEIRVERY NUMBERS AND THEIR CROWDED AND SWIFT MOVEMENT DEPRIVED THEM OF THATPOSSIBILITY AND RENDERED IT NOT ONLY DIFFICULT BUT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THERUSSIANS TO STOP THIS MOVEMENT TO WHICH THE FRENCH WERE DIRECTING ALLTHEIR ENERGIES BEYOND A CERTAIN LIMIT NO MECHANICAL DISRUPTION OF THEBODY COULD HASTEN THE PROCESS OF DECOMPOSITIONA LUMP OF SNOW CANNOT BE MELTED INSTANTANEOUSLY THERE IS A CERTAINLIMIT OF TIME IN LESS THAN WHICH NO AMOUNT OF HEAT CAN MELT THE SNOW ONTHE CONTRARY THE GREATER THE HEAT THE MORE SOLIDIFIED THE REMAINING SNOWBECOMESOF THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS KUTZOV ALONE UNDERSTOOD THIS WHEN THE FLIGHTOF THE FRENCH ARMY ALONG THE SMOLNSK ROAD BECAME WELL DEFINED WHATKONOVNTSYN HAD FORESEEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE ELEVENTH OF OCTOBER BEGANTO OCCUR THE SUPERIOR OFFICERS ALL WANTED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVESTO CUT OFF TO SEIZE TO CAPTURE AND TO OVERTHROW THE FRENCH AND ALLCLAMORED FOR ACTIONKUTZOV ALONE USED ALL HIS POWER AND SUCH POWER IS VERY LIMITED IN THECASE OF ANY COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO PREVENT AN ATTACKHE COULD NOT TELL THEM WHAT WE SAY NOW WHY FIGHT WHY BLOCK THE ROADLOSING OUR OWN MEN AND INHUMANLY SLAUGHTERING UNFORTUNATE WRETCHES WHATIS THE USE OF THAT WHEN A THIRD OF THEIR ARMY HAS MELTED AWAY ON THEROAD FROM MOSCOW TO VYZMA WITHOUT ANY BATTLE BUT DRAWING FROM HISAGED WISDOM WHAT THEY COULD UNDERSTAND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GOLDENBRIDGE AND THEY LAUGHED AT AND SLANDERED HIM FLINGING THEMSELVES ONRENDING AND EXULTING OVER THE DYING BEASTERMLOV MILORDOVICH PLTOV AND OTHERS IN PROXIMITY TO THE FRENCHNEAR VYZMA COULD NOT RESIST THEIR DESIRE TO CUT OFF AND BREAK UP TWOFRENCH CORPS AND BY WAY OF

CONTINUED WHILE STEADILY MELTINGAWAY TO PURSUE ITS FATAL PATH TO SMOLNSKBOOK FOURTEEN CHAPTER ITHE BATTLE OF BORODIN WITH THE OCCUPATION OF MOSCOW THAT FOLLOWED ITAND THE FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH WITHOUT FURTHER CONFLICTS IS ONE OF THEMOST INSTRUCTIVE PHENOMENA IN HISTORYALL HISTORIANS AGREE THAT THE EXTERNAL ACTIVITY OF STATES AND NATIONSIN THEIR CONFLICTS WITH ONE ANOTHER IS EXPRESSED IN WARS AND THAT AS ADIRECT RESULT OF GREATER OR LESS SUCCESS IN WAR THE POLITICAL STRENGTHOF STATES AND NATIONS INCREASES OR DECREASESSTRANGE AS MAY BE THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF HOW SOME KING OR EMPERORHAVING QUARRELED WITH ANOTHER COLLECTS AN ARMY FIGHTS HIS ENEMYSARMY GAINS A VICTORY BY KILLING THREE FIVE OR TEN THOUSAND MEN ANDSUBJUGATES A KINGDOM AND AN ENTIRE NATION OF SEVERAL MILLIONS ALLTHE FACTS OF HISTORY AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT CONFIRM THE TRUTH OF THESTATEMENT THAT THE GREATER OR LESSER SUCCESS OF ONE ARMY AGAINST ANOTHERIS THE CAUSE OR AT LEAST AN ESSENTIAL INDICATION OF AN INCREASE ORDECREASE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE NATIONEVEN THOUGH IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLEWHY THE DEFEAT OF AN ARMYA HUNDREDTH PART OF A NATIONSHOULD OBLIGETHAT WHOLE NATION TO SUBMIT AN ARMY GAINS A VICTORY AND AT ONCE THERIGHTS OF THE CONQUERING NATION HAVE INCREASED TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEDEFEATED AN ARMY HAS SUFFERED DEFEAT AND AT ONCE A PEOPLE LOSES ITSRIGHTS IN PROPORTION TO THE SEVERITY OF THE REVERSE AND IF ITS ARMYSUFFERS A COMPLETE DEFEAT THE NATION IS QUITE SUBJUGATEDSO ACCORDING TO HISTORY IT HAS BEEN FOUND FROM THE MOST ANCIENT TIMESAND SO IT IS TO OUR OWN DAY ALL NAPOLEONS WARS SERVE TO CONFIRM THISRULE IN PROPORTION TO THE DEFEAT OF THE AUSTRIAN ARMY AUSTRIA LOSESITS RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS AND THE STRENGTH OF FRANCE INCREASE THEVICTORIES OF THE FRENCH AT JENA AND AUERSTDT DESTROY THE INDEPENDENTEXISTENCE OF PRUSSIABUT THEN IN  THE FRENCH GAIN A VICTORY NEAR MOSCOW MOSCOW ISTAKEN AND AFTER THAT WITH NO FURTHER BATTLES IT IS NOT RUSSIA THATCEASES TO EXIST BUT THE FRENCH ARMY OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ANDTHEN NAPOLEONIC FRANCE ITSELF TO STRAIN THE FACTS TO FIT THE RULES OFHISTORY TO SAY THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE AT BORODIN REMAINED IN THEHANDS OF THE RUSSIANS OR THAT AFTER MOSCOW THERE WERE OTHER BATTLESTHAT DESTROYED NAPOLEONS ARMY IS IMPOSSIBLEAFTER THE FRENCH VICTORY AT BORODIN THERE WAS NO GENERAL ENGAGEMENT NORANY THAT WERE AT ALL SERIOUS YET THE FRENCH ARMY CEASED TO EXIST WHATDOES THIS MEAN IF IT WERE AN EXAMPLE TAKEN FROM THE HISTORY OF CHINAWE MIGHT SAY THAT IT WAS NOT AN HISTORIC PHENOMENON WHICH IS THEHISTORIANS USUAL EXPEDIENT WHEN ANYTHING DOES NOT FIT THEIR STANDARDSIF THE MATTER CONCERNED SOME BRIEF CONFLICT IN WHICH ONLY A SMALL NUMBEROF TROOPS TOOK PART WE MIGHT TREAT IT AS AN EXCEPTION BUT THIS EVENTOCCURRED BEFORE OUR FATHERS EYES AND FOR THEM IT WAS A QUESTION OF THELIFE OR DEATH OF THEIR FATHERLAND AND IT HAPPENED IN THE GREATEST OFALL KNOWN WARSTHE PERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGN OF  FROM THE BATTLE OF BORODIN TO THEEXPULSION OF THE FRENCH PROVED THAT THE WINNING OF A BATTLE DOES NOTPRODUCE A CONQUEST AND IS NOT EVEN AN INVARIABLE INDICATION OF CONQUESTIT PROVED THAT THE FORCE WHICH DECIDES THE FATE OF PEOPLES LIES NOT INTHE CONQUERORS NOR EVEN IN ARMIES AND BATTLES BUT IN SOMETHING ELSETHE FRENCH HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE FRENCH ARMYBEFORE IT LEFT MOSCOW AFFIRM THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER IN THE GRAND ARMYEXCEPT THE CAVALRY THE ARTILLERY AND THE TRANSPORTTHERE WAS NO FORAGEFOR THE HORSES OR THE CATTLE THAT WAS A MISFORTUNE NO ONE COULD REMEDYFOR THE PEASANTS OF THE DISTRICT BURNED THEIR HAY RATHER THAN LET THEFRENCH HAVE ITTHE VICTORY GAINED DID NOT BRING THE USUAL RESULTS BECAUSE THE PEASANTSKARP AND VLAS WHO AFTER THE FRENCH HAD EVACUATED MOSCOW DROVE IN THEIRCARTS TO PILLAGE THE TOWN AND IN GENERAL PERSONALLY FAILED TO MANIFESTANY HEROIC FEELINGS AND THE WHOLE INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE OF SUCHPEASANTS DID NOT BRING THEIR HAY TO MOSCOW FOR THE HIGH PRICE OFFEREDTHEM BUT BURNED IT INSTEADLET US IMAGINE TWO MEN WHO HAVE COME OUT TO FIGHT A DUEL WITH RAPIERSACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF THE ART OF FENCING THE FENCING HASGONE ON FOR SOME TIME SUDDENLY ONE OF THE COMBATANTS FEELING HIMSELFWOUNDED AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MATTER IS NO JOKE BUT CONCERNS HISLIFE THROWS DOWN HIS RAPIER AND SEIZING THE FIRST CUDGEL THAT COMES TOHAND BEGINS TO BRANDISH IT THEN LET US IMAGINE THAT THE COMBATANT WHOSO SENSIBLY EMPLOYED THE BEST AND SIMPLEST MEANS TO ATTAIN HIS END WASAT THE SAME TIME INFLUENCED BY TRADITIONS OF CHIVALRY AND DESIRING TOCONCEAL THE FACTS OF THE CASE INSISTED THAT HE HAD GAINED HIS VICTORYWITH THE RAPIER ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF ART ONE CAN IMAGINE WHATCONFUSION AND OBSCURITY WOULD RESULT FROM SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF THE DUELTHE FENCER WHO DEMANDED A CONTEST ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FENCING WASTHE FRENCH ARMY HIS OPPONENT WHO THREW AWAY THE RAPIER AND SNATCHED UPTHE CUDGEL WAS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THOSE WHO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE MATTERACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FENCING ARE THE HISTORIANS WHO HAVE DESCRIBEDTHE EVENTAFTER THE BURNING OF SMOLNSK A WAR BEGAN WHICH DID NOT FOLLOW ANYPREVIOUS TRADITIONS OF WAR THE BURNING OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES THERETREATS AFTER BATTLES THE BLOW DEALT AT BORODIN AND THE RENEWEDRETREAT THE BURNING OF MOSCOW THE CAPTURE OF MARAUDERS THE SEIZURE OFTRANSPORTS AND THE GUERRILLA WAR WERE ALL DEPARTURES FROM THE RULESNAPOLEON FELT THIS AND FROM THE TIME HE TOOK UP THE CORRECT FENCINGATTITUDE IN MOSCOW AND INSTEAD OF HIS OPPONENTS RAPIER SAW A CUDGELRAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD HE DID NOT CEASE TO COMPLAIN TO KUTZOV AND TOTHE EMPEROR ALEXANDER THAT THE WAR WAS BEING CARRIED ON CONTRARY TO ALLTHE RULESAS IF THERE WERE ANY RULES FOR KILLING PEOPLE IN SPITE OF THECOMPLAINTS OF THE FRENCH AS TO THE NONOBSERVANCE OF THE RULES INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT TO SOME HIGHLY PLACED RUSSIANS IT SEEMED RATHERDISGRACEFUL TO FIGHT WITH A CUDGEL AND THEY WANTED TO ASSUME A POSE ENQUARTE OR EN TIERCE ACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES AND TO MAKE AN ADROITTHRUST EN PRIME AND SO ONTHE CUDGEL OF THE PEOPLES WAR WAS LIFTEDWITH ALL ITS MENACING AND MAJESTIC STRENGTH AND WITHOUT CONSULTINGANYONES TASTES OR RULES AND REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING ELSE IT ROSE ANDFELL WITH STUPID SIMPLICITY BUT CONSISTENTLY AND BELABORED THE FRENCHTILL THE WHOLE INVASION HAD PERISHEDAND IT IS WELL FOR A PEOPLE WHO DO NOTAS THE FRENCH DID IN SALUTEACCORDING TO ALL THE RULES OF ART AND PRESENTING THE HILT OF THEIRRAPIER GRACEFULLY AND POLITELY HAND IT TO THEIR MAGNANIMOUS CONQUERORBUT AT THE MOMENT OF TRIAL WITHOUT ASKING WHAT RULES OTHERS HAVEADOPTED IN SIMILAR CASES SIMPLY AND EASILY PICK UP THE FIRST CUDGELTHAT COMES TO HAND AND STRIKE WITH IT TILL THE FEELING OF RESENTMENT ANDREVENGE IN THEIR SOUL YIELDS TO A FEELING OF CONTEMPT AND COMPASSIONCHAPTER IIONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS AND ADVANTAGEOUS DEPARTURES FROM THE SOCALLEDLAWS OF WAR IS THE ACTION OF SCATTERED GROUPS AGAINST MEN PRESSEDTOGETHER IN A MASS SUCH ACTION ALWAYS OCCURS IN WARS THAT TAKE ON ANATIONAL CHARACTER IN SUCH ACTIONS INSTEAD OF TWO CROWDS OPPOSINGEACH OTHER THE MEN DISPERSE ATTACK SINGLY RUN AWAY WHEN ATTACKED BYSTRONGER FORCES BUT AGAIN ATTACK WHEN OPPORTUNITY OFFERS THIS WAS DONEBY THE GUERRILLAS IN SPAIN BY THE MOUNTAIN TRIBES IN THE CAUCASUS ANDBY THE RUSSIANS IN PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THIS KIND OF WAR GUERRILLA WARFARE AND ASSUME THATBY SO CALLING IT THEY HAVE EXPLAINED ITS MEANING BUT SUCH A WAR DOESNOT FIT IN UNDER ANY RULE AND IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO A WELLKNOWN RULEOF TACTICS WHICH IS ACCEPTED AS INFALLIBLE THAT RULE SAYS THAT ANATTACKER SHOULD CONCENTRATE HIS FORCES IN ORDER TO BE STRONGER THAN HISOPPONENT AT THE MOMENT OF CONFLICTGUERRILLA WAR ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AS HISTORY SHOWS DIRECTLY INFRINGESTHAT RULETHIS CONTRADICTION ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT MILITARY SCIENCE ASSUMESTHE STRENGTH OF AN ARMY TO BE IDENTICAL WITH ITS NUMBERS MILITARYSCIENCE SAYS THAT THE MORE TROOPS THE GREATER THE STRENGTH LES GROSBATAILLONS ONT TOUJOURS RAISON      LARGE BATTALIONS ARE ALWAYS VICTORIOUSFOR MILITARY SCIENCE TO SAY THIS IS LIKE DEFINING MOMENTUM IN MECHANICSBY REFERENCE TO THE MASS ONLY STATING THAT MOMENTA ARE EQUAL OR UNEQUALTO EACH OTHER SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MASSES INVOLVED ARE EQUAL OR UNEQUALMOMENTUM QUANTITY OF MOTION IS THE PRODUCT OF MASS AND VELOCITYIN MILITARY AFFAIRS THE STRENGTH OF AN ARMY IS THE PRODUCT OF ITS MASSAND SOME UNKNOWN XMILITARY SCIENCE SEEING IN HISTORY INNUMERABLE INSTANCES OF THE FACTTHAT THE SIZE OF ANY ARMY DOES NOT COINCIDE WITH ITS STRENGTH AND THATSMALL DETACHMENTS DEFEAT LARGER ONES OBSCURELY ADMITS THE EXISTENCEOF THIS UNKNOWN FACTOR AND TRIES TO DISCOVER ITNOW IN A GEOMETRICFORMATION NOW IN THE EQUIPMENT EMPLOYED NOW AND MOST USUALLY IN THEGENIUS OF THE COMMANDERS BUT THE ASSIGNMENT OF THESE VARIOUS MEANINGSTO THE FACTOR DOES NOT YIELD RESULTS WHICH ACCORD WITH THE HISTORICFACTSYET IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO ABANDON THE FALSE VIEW ADOPTED TO GRATIFYTHE HEROES OF THE EFFICACY OF THE DIRECTIONS ISSUED IN WARTIME BYCOMMANDERS IN ORDER TO FIND THIS UNKNOWN QUANTITYTHAT UNKNOWN QUANTITY IS THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY THAT IS TO SAY THEGREATER OR LESSER READINESS TO FIGHT AND FACE DANGER FELT BY ALL THE MENCOMPOSING AN ARMY QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF WHETHER THEY ARE OR ARE NOTFIGHTING UNDER THE COMMAND OF A GENIUS IN TWOOR THREELINE FORMATIONWITH CUDGELS OR WITH RIFLES THAT REPEAT THIRTY TIMES A MINUTE MENWHO WANT TO FIGHT WILL ALWAYS PUT THEMSELVES IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUSCONDITIONS FOR FIGHTINGTHE SPIRIT OF AN ARMY IS THE FACTOR WHICH MULTIPLIED BY THE MASS GIVESTHE RESULTING FORCE TO DEFINE AND EXPRESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THISUNKNOWN FACTORTHE SPIRIT OF AN ARMYIS A PROBLEM FOR SCIENCETHIS PROBLEM IS ONLY SOLVABLE IF WE CEASE ARBITRARILY TO SUBSTITUTEFOR THE UNKNOWN X ITSELF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THAT FORCE BECOMESAPPARENTSUCH AS THE COMMANDS OF THE GENERAL THE EQUIPMENT EMPLOYEDAND SO ONMISTAKING THESE FOR THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FACTORAND IF WE RECOGNIZE THIS UNKNOWN QUANTITY IN ITS ENTIRETY AS BEINGTHE GREATER OR LESSER DESIRE TO FIGHT AND TO FACE DANGER ONLY THENEXPRESSING KNOWN HISTORIC FACTS BY EQUATIONS AND COMPARING THE RELATIVESIGNIFICANCE OF THIS FACTOR CAN WE HOPE TO DEFINE THE UNKNOWNTEN MEN BATTALIONS OR DIVISIONS FIGHTING FIFTEEN MEN BATTALIONS ORDIVISIONS CONQUERTHAT IS KILL OR TAKE CAPTIVEALL THE OTHERS WHILETHEMSELVES LOSING FOUR SO THAT ON THE ONE SIDE FOUR AND ON THE OTHERFIFTEEN WERE LOST CONSEQUENTLY THE FOUR WERE EQUAL TO THE FIFTEEN ANDTHEREFORE X  Y CONSEQUENTLY XY   THIS EQUATION DOES NOTGIVE US THE VALUE OF THE UNKNOWN FACTOR BUT GIVES US A RATIO BETWEEN TWOUNKNOWNS AND BY BRINGING VARIOUSLY SELECTED HISTORIC UNITS BATTLESCAMPAIGNS PERIODS OF WAR INTO SUCH EQUATIONS A SERIES OF NUMBERSCOULD BE OBTAINED IN WHICH CERTAIN LAWS SHOULD EXIST AND MIGHT BEDISCOVEREDTHE TACTICAL RULE THAT AN ARMY SHOULD ACT IN MASSES WHEN ATTACKING ANDIN SMALLER GROUPS IN RETREAT UNCONSCIOUSLY CONFIRMS THE TRUTH THAT THESTRENGTH OF AN ARMY DEPENDS ON ITS SPIRIT TO LEAD MEN FORWARD UNDERFIRE MORE DISCIPLINE OBTAINABLE ONLY BY MOVEMENT IN MASSES IS NEEDEDTHAN IS NEEDED TO RESIST ATTACKS BUT THIS RULE WHICH LEAVES OUT OFACCOUNT THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY CONTINUALLY PROVES INCORRECT AND IS INPARTICULARLY STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE FACTS WHEN SOME STRONG RISE ORFALL IN THE SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS OCCURS AS IN ALL NATIONAL WARSTHE FRENCH RETREATING IN THOUGH ACCORDING TO TACTICS THEY SHOULDHAVE SEPARATED INTO DETACHMENTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVESCONGREGATED INTOA MASS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE ARMY HAD SO FALLEN THAT ONLY THE MASSHELD THE ARMY TOGETHER THE RUSSIANS ON THE CONTRARY OUGHT ACCORDINGTO TACTICS TO HAVE ATTACKED IN MASS BUT IN FACT THEY SPLIT UPINTO SMALL UNITS BECAUSE THEIR SPIRIT HAD SO RISEN THAT SEPARATEINDIVIDUALS WITHOUT ORDERS DEALT BLOWS AT THE FRENCH WITHOUT NEEDINGANY COMPULSION TO INDUCE THEM TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO HARDSHIPS ANDDANGERSCHAPTER IIITHE SOCALLED PARTISAN WAR BEGAN WITH THE ENTRY OF THE FRENCH INTOSMOLNSKBEFORE

SEEMED TO HIMHE HAD BEEN NO MORE FREE THAN NOW WHEN THEYLOCKED HIM UP AT NIGHT IN A STABLE OF ALL THAT HE HIMSELF SUBSEQUENTLYTERMED HIS SUFFERINGS BUT WHICH AT THE TIME HE SCARCELY FELT THE WORSTWAS

PAIN THOUGH AT NIGHT HIS FEET WERE MORETERRIBLE TO LOOK AT THAN BEFORE HOWEVER HE DID NOT LOOK AT THEM NOWBUT THOUGHT OF OTHER THINGSONLY NOW DID PIERRE REALIZE THE FULL STRENGTH OF LIFE IN MAN AND THESAVING POWER HE HAS OF TRANSFERRING HIS ATTENTION FROM ONE THINGTO ANOTHER WHICH IS LIKE THE SAFETY VALVE OF A BOILER THAT ALLOWSSUPERFLUOUS STEAM TO BLOW OFF WHEN THE PRESSURE EXCEEDS A CERTAIN LIMITHE DID NOT SEE AND DID NOT HEAR HOW THEY SHOT THE PRISONERS WHO LAGGEDBEHIND THOUGH MORE THAN A HUNDRED PERISHED IN THAT WAY HE DID NOTTHINK OF KARATEV WHO GREW WEAKER EVERY DAY AND EVIDENTLY WOULD SOONHAVE TO SHARE THAT FATE STILL LESS DID PIERRE THINK ABOUT HIMSELF THEHARDER HIS POSITION BECAME AND THE MORE TERRIBLE THE FUTURE THE MOREINDEPENDENT OF THAT POSITION IN WHICH HE FOUND

ACTIONS OF THE MASS TO THE WILL OF ONE MAN WOULD HAVE FOUND ITIMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE STORY OF THE RETREAT FIT THEIR THEORY BUTNO MOUNTAINS OF BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY THE HISTORIANS ABOUT

PERPLEXITY WHO HAS NOT ASKED HIMSELF HOW IT ISTHAT THE FRENCH WERE NOT ALL CAPTURED OR DESTROYED WHEN OUR THREE ARMIESSURROUNDED THEM IN SUPERIOR NUMBERS WHEN THE DISORDERED FRENCH HUNGRYAND FREEZING SURRENDERED IN CROWDS AND WHEN AS THE HISTORIANS RELATETHE AIM OF THE RUSSIANS WAS TO STOP THE FRENCH TO CUT THEM OFF ANDCAPTURE THEM ALLHOW WAS IT THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WHEN NUMERICALLY WEAKER THAN THEFRENCH HAD GIVEN BATTLE AT BORODIN DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSE WHEN ITHAD SURROUNDED THE FRENCH ON THREE SIDES AND WHEN ITS AIM WAS TO CAPTURETHEM CAN THE FRENCH BE SO ENORMOUSLY SUPERIOR TO US THAT WHEN WE HADSURROUNDED THEM WITH SUPERIOR FORCES WE COULD NOT BEAT THEM HOW COULDTHAT HAPPENHISTORY OR WHAT IS CALLED BY THAT NAME REPLYING TO THESE QUESTIONSSAYS THAT THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE KUTZOV AND TORMSOV AND CHICHAGV ANDTHIS MAN AND THAT MAN DID NOT EXECUTE SUCH AND SUCH MANEUVERSBUT WHY DID THEY NOT EXECUTE THOSE MANEUVERS AND WHY IF THEY WEREGUILTY OF NOT CARRYING OUT A PREARRANGED PLAN WERE THEY NOT TRIED ANDPUNISHED BUT EVEN IF WE ADMITTED THAT KUTZOV CHICHAGV AND OTHERSWERE THE CAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN FAILURES IT IS STILL INCOMPREHENSIBLEWHY THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY BEING WHAT IT WAS AT KRSNOE ANDAT THE BERZINA IN BOTH CASES WE HAD SUPERIOR FORCES THE FRENCH ARMYWITH ITS MARSHALS KINGS AND EMPEROR WAS NOT CAPTURED IF THAT WAS WHATTHE RUSSIANS AIMED ATTHE EXPLANATION OF THIS STRANGE FACT GIVEN BY RUSSIAN MILITARYHISTORIANS TO THE EFFECT THAT KUTZOV HINDERED AN ATTACK IS UNFOUNDEDFOR WE KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE TROOPS FROM ATTACKING ATVYZMA AND TARTINOWHY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMYWHICH WITH INFERIOR FORCES HAD WITHSTOOD THEENEMY IN FULL STRENGTH AT BORODINDEFEATED AT KRSNOE AND THE BERZINABY THE DISORGANIZED CROWDS OF THE FRENCH WHEN IT WAS NUMERICALLYSUPERIORIF THE AIM OF THE RUSSIANS CONSISTED IN CUTTING OFF AND CAPTURINGNAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALSAND THAT AIM WAS NOT MERELY FRUSTRATED BUT ALLATTEMPTS TO ATTAIN IT WERE MOST SHAMEFULLY BAFFLEDTHEN THIS LAST PERIODOF THE CAMPAIGN IS QUITE RIGHTLY CONSIDERED BY THE FRENCH TO BE ASERIES OF VICTORIES AND QUITE WRONGLY CONSIDERED VICTORIOUS BY RUSSIANHISTORIANSTHE RUSSIAN MILITARY HISTORIANS IN SO FAR AS THEY SUBMIT TO CLAIMSOF LOGIC MUST ADMIT THAT CONCLUSION AND IN SPITE OF THEIR LYRICALRHAPSODIES ABOUT VALOR DEVOTION AND SO FORTH MUST RELUCTANTLY ADMITTHAT THE FRENCH RETREAT FROM MOSCOW WAS A SERIES OF VICTORIES FORNAPOLEON AND DEFEATS FOR KUTZOVBUT PUTTING NATIONAL VANITY ENTIRELY ASIDE ONE FEELS THAT SUCH ACONCLUSION INVOLVES A CONTRADICTION SINCE THE SERIES OF FRENCHVICTORIES BROUGHT THE FRENCH COMPLETE DESTRUCTION WHILE THE SERIESOF RUSSIAN DEFEATS LED TO THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THEIR ENEMY AND THELIBERATION OF THEIR COUNTRYTHE SOURCE OF THIS CONTRADICTION LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE HISTORIANSSTUDYING THE EVENTS FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SOVEREIGNS AND THE GENERALSFROM MEMOIRS REPORTS PROJECTS AND SO FORTH HAVE ATTRIBUTED TO THISLAST PERIOD OF THE WAR OF  AN AIM THAT NEVER EXISTED NAMELY THAT OFCUTTING OFF AND CAPTURING NAPOLEON WITH HIS MARSHALS AND HIS ARMYTHERE NEVER WAS OR COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH AN AIM FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEENSENSELESS AND ITS ATTAINMENT QUITE IMPOSSIBLEIT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS FIRST BECAUSE NAPOLEONS DISORGANIZEDARMY WAS FLYING FROM RUSSIA WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED THAT IS TO SAY WASDOING JUST WHAT EVERY RUSSIAN DESIRED SO WHAT WAS THE USE OF PERFORMINGVARIOUS OPERATIONS ON THE FRENCH WHO WERE RUNNING AWAY AS FAST AS THEYPOSSIBLY COULDSECONDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS TO BLOCK THE PASSAGE OF MEN WHOSEWHOLE ENERGY WAS DIRECTED TO FLIGHTTHIRDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS TO SACRIFICE ONES OWN TROOPS INORDER TO DESTROY THE FRENCH ARMY WHICH WITHOUT EXTERNAL INTERFERENCEWAS DESTROYING ITSELF AT SUCH A RATE THAT THOUGH ITS PATH WAS NOTBLOCKED IT COULD NOT CARRY ACROSS THE FRONTIER MORE THAN IT ACTUALLYDID IN DECEMBER NAMELY A HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ORIGINAL ARMYFOURTHLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS TO WISH TO TAKE CAPTIVE THEEMPEROR KINGS AND DUKESWHOSE CAPTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE HIGHESTDEGREE EMBARRASSING FOR THE RUSSIANS AS THE MOST ADROIT DIPLOMATISTS OFTHE TIME JOSEPH DE MAISTRE AND OTHERS RECOGNIZED STILL MORE SENSELESSWOULD HAVE BEEN THE WISH TO CAPTURE ARMY CORPS OF THE FRENCH WHEN OUROWN ARMY HAD MELTED AWAY TO HALF BEFORE REACHING KRSNOE AND A WHOLEDIVISION WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED TO CONVOY THE CORPS OF PRISONERS ANDWHEN OUR MEN WERE NOT ALWAYS GETTING FULL RATIONS AND THE PRISONERSALREADY TAKEN WERE PERISHING OF HUNGERALL THE PROFOUND PLANS ABOUT CUTTING OFF AND CAPTURING NAPOLEON AND HISARMY WERE LIKE THE PLAN OF A MARKET GARDENER WHO WHEN DRIVING OUT OFHIS GARDEN A COW THAT HAD TRAMPLED DOWN THE BEDS HE HAD PLANTED SHOULDRUN TO THE GATE AND HIT THE COW ON THE HEAD THE ONLY THING TO BE SAIDIN EXCUSE OF THAT GARDENER WOULD BE THAT HE WAS VERY ANGRY BUT NOT EVENTHAT COULD BE SAID FOR THOSE WHO DREW UP THIS PROJECT FOR IT WAS NOTTHEY WHO HAD SUFFERED FROM THE TRAMPLED BEDSBUT BESIDES THE FACT THAT CUTTING OFF NAPOLEON WITH HIS ARMY WOULD HAVEBEEN SENSELESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLEIT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FIRST BECAUSEAS EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT A THREEMILEMOVEMENT OF COLUMNS ON A BATTLEFIELD NEVER COINCIDES WITH THE PLANSTHEPROBABILITY OF CHICHAGV KUTZOV AND WITTGENSTEIN EFFECTING A JUNCTIONON TIME AT AN APPOINTED PLACE WAS SO REMOTE AS TO BE TANTAMOUNT TOIMPOSSIBILITY AS IN FACT THOUGHT KUTZOV WHO WHEN HE RECEIVED THE PLANREMARKED THAT DIVERSIONS PLANNED OVER GREAT DISTANCES DO NOT YIELD THEDESIRED RESULTSSECONDLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE TO PARALYZE THE MOMENTUM WITH WHICHNAPOLEONS ARMY WAS RETIRING INCOMPARABLY GREATER FORCES THAN THERUSSIANS POSSESSED WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIREDTHIRDLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE MILITARY TERM TO CUT OFF HAS NOMEANING ONE CAN CUT OFF A SLICE OF BREAD BUT NOT AN ARMY TO CUT OFFAN ARMYTO BAR ITS ROADIS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTYOF ROOM TO AVOID CAPTURE AND THERE IS THE NIGHT WHEN NOTHING CAN BESEEN AS THE MILITARY SCIENTISTS MIGHT CONVINCE THEMSELVES BY THEEXAMPLE OF KRSNOE AND OF THE BERZINA IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO CAPTUREPRISONERS IF THEY AGREE TO BE CAPTURED JUST AS IT IS ONLY POSSIBLETO CATCH A SWALLOW IF IT SETTLES ON ONES HAND MEN CAN ONLY BE TAKENPRISONERS IF THEY SURRENDER ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF STRATEGY ANDTACTICS AS THE GERMANS DID BUT THE FRENCH TROOPS QUITE RIGHTLY DID NOTCONSIDER THAT THIS SUITED THEM SINCE DEATH BY HUNGER AND COLD AWAITEDTHEM IN FLIGHT OR CAPTIVITY ALIKEFOURTHLY AND CHIEFLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE NEVER SINCE THE WORLDBEGAN HAS A WAR BEEN FOUGHT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS AS THOSE THAT OBTAINEDIN  AND THE RUSSIAN ARMY IN ITS PURSUIT OF THE FRENCH STRAINED ITSSTRENGTH TO THE UTMOST AND COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYINGITSELFDURING THE MOVEMENT OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY FROM TARTINO TO KRSNOE ITLOST FIFTY THOUSAND SICK OR STRAGGLERS THAT IS A NUMBER EQUAL TO THEPOPULATION OF A LARGE PROVINCIAL TOWN HALF THE MEN FELL OUT OF THE ARMYWITHOUT A BATTLEAND IT IS OF THIS PERIOD OF THE CAMPAIGNWHEN THE ARMY LACKED BOOTSAND SHEEPSKIN COATS WAS SHORT OF PROVISIONS AND WITHOUT VODKA ANDWAS CAMPING OUT AT NIGHT FOR MONTHS IN THE SNOW WITH FIFTEEN DEGREESOF FROST WHEN THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS OF DAYLIGHT ANDTHE REST WAS NIGHT IN WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF DISCIPLINE CANNOT BEMAINTAINED WHEN MEN WERE TAKEN INTO THAT REGION OF DEATH WHEREDISCIPLINE FAILS NOT FOR A FEW HOURS ONLY AS IN A BATTLE BUT FORMONTHS WHERE THEY WERE EVERY MOMENT FIGHTING DEATH FROM HUNGER ANDCOLD WHEN HALF THE ARMY PERISHED IN A SINGLE MONTHIT IS OF THIS PERIODOF THE CAMPAIGN THAT THE HISTORIANS TELL US HOW MILORDOVICH SHOULD HAVEMADE A FLANK MARCH TO SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE TORMSOV TO ANOTHER PLACEAND CHICHAGV SHOULD HAVE CROSSED MORE THAN KNEEDEEP IN SNOW TOSOMEWHERE ELSE AND HOW SOANDSO ROUTED AND CUT OFF THE FRENCH ANDSO ON AND SO ONTHE RUSSIANS HALF OF WHOM DIED DID ALL THAT COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEENDONE TO ATTAIN AN END WORTHY OF THE NATION AND THEY ARE NOT TO BLAMEBECAUSE OTHER RUSSIANS SITTING IN WARM ROOMS PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULDDO WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLEALL THAT STRANGE CONTRADICTION NOW DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BETWEEN THEFACTS AND THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS ONLY ARISES BECAUSE THE HISTORIANSDEALING WITH THE MATTER HAVE WRITTEN THE HISTORY OF THE BEAUTIFUL WORDSAND SENTIMENTS OF VARIOUS GENERALS AND NOT THE HISTORY OF THE EVENTSTO THEM THE WORDS OF MILORDOVICH SEEM VERY INTERESTING AND SO DO THEIRSURMISES AND THE REWARDS THIS OR THAT GENERAL RECEIVED BUT THE QUESTIONOF THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND MEN WHO WERE LEFT IN HOSPITALS AND IN GRAVESDOES NOT EVEN INTEREST THEM FOR IT DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE RANGE OFTHEIR INVESTIGATIONYET ONE NEED ONLY DISCARD THE STUDY OF THE REPORTS AND GENERAL PLANS ANDCONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO TOOK ADIRECT PART IN THE EVENTS AND ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT SEEMED INSOLUBLEEASILY AND SIMPLY RECEIVE AN IMMEDIATE AND CERTAIN SOLUTIONTHE AIM OF CUTTING OFF NAPOLEON AND HIS ARMY NEVER EXISTED EXCEPT INTHE IMAGINATIONS OF A DOZEN PEOPLE IT COULD NOT EXIST BECAUSE IT WASSENSELESS AND UNATTAINABLETHE PEOPLE HAD A SINGLE AIM TO FREE THEIR LAND FROM INVASION THAT AIMWAS ATTAINED IN THE FIRST PLACE OF ITSELF AS THE FRENCH RAN AWAYAND SO IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY NOT TO STOP THEIR FLIGHT SECONDLY IT WASATTAINED BY THE GUERRILLA WARFARE WHICH WAS DESTROYING THE FRENCH ANDTHIRDLY BY THE FACT THAT A LARGE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS FOLLOWING THE FRENCHREADY TO USE ITS STRENGTH IN CASE THEIR MOVEMENT STOPPEDTHE RUSSIAN ARMY HAD TO ACT LIKE A WHIP TO A RUNNING ANIMAL AND THEEXPERIENCED DRIVER KNEW IT WAS BETTER TO HOLD THE WHIP RAISED AS AMENACE THAN TO STRIKE THE RUNNING ANIMAL ON THE HEADBOOK FIFTEEN   CHAPTER IWHEN SEEING A DYING

PURSUED THEM CONTINUED AS FAR AS KRSNOE WITHOUT A BATTLE THEFLIGHT WAS SO RAPID THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY PURSUING THE FRENCH COULDNOT KEEP UP WITH THEM CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY HORSES BROKE DOWN AND THEINFORMATION RECEIVED OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH WAS NEVER RELIABLETHE MEN IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY WERE SO WORN OUT BY THIS CONTINUOUS MARCHINGAT THE RATE OF TWENTYSEVEN MILES A DAY THAT THEY COULD NOT GO ANYFASTERTO REALIZE THE DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY IT IS ONLYNECESSARY TO GRASP CLEARLY THE MEANING OF THE FACT THAT WHILE NOTLOSING MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND KILLED AND WOUNDED AFTER TARTINO ANDLESS THAN A HUNDRED PRISONERS THE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH LEFT THAT PLACE AHUNDRED THOUSAND STRONG REACHED KRSNOE WITH ONLY FIFTY THOUSANDTHE RAPIDITY OF THE RUSSIAN PURSUIT WAS JUST AS DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR ARMYAS THE FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH WAS TO THEIRS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THATTHE RUSSIAN ARMY MOVED VOLUNTARILY WITH NO SUCH THREAT OF DESTRUCTIONAS HUNG OVER THE FRENCH AND THAT THE SICK FRENCHMEN WERE LEFT BEHINDIN ENEMY HANDS WHILE THE SICK RUSSIANS LEFT BEHIND WERE AMONG THEIROWN PEOPLE THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE WASTAGE OF NAPOLEONS ARMY WASTHE RAPIDITY OF ITS MOVEMENT AND A CONVINCING PROOF OF THIS IS THECORRESPONDING DECREASE OF THE RUSSIAN ARMYKUTZOV AS FAR AS WAS IN HIS POWER INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CHECK THEMOVEMENT OF THE FRENCH AS WAS DESIRED IN PETERSBURG AND BY THE RUSSIANARMY GENERALS DIRECTED HIS WHOLE ACTIVITY HERE AS HE HAD DONE ATTARTINO AND VYZMA TO HASTENING IT ON WHILE EASING THE MOVEMENT OF OURARMYBUT BESIDES THIS SINCE THE EXHAUSTION AND ENORMOUS DIMINUTION OF THEARMY CAUSED BY THE RAPIDITY OF THE ADVANCE HAD BECOME EVIDENT ANOTHERREASON FOR SLACKENING THE PACE AND DELAYING PRESENTED ITSELF TO KUTZOVTHE AIM OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS TO PURSUE THE FRENCH THE ROAD THEFRENCH WOULD TAKE WAS UNKNOWN AND SO THE CLOSER OUR TROOPS TROD ONTHEIR HEELS THE GREATER DISTANCE THEY HAD TO COVER ONLY BY FOLLOWINGAT SOME DISTANCE COULD ONE CUT ACROSS THE ZIGZAG PATH OF THE FRENCH ALLTHE ARTFUL MANEUVERS SUGGESTED BY OUR GENERALS MEANT FRESH MOVEMENTS OFTHE ARMY AND A LENGTHENING OF ITS MARCHES WHEREAS THE ONLY REASONABLEAIM WAS TO SHORTEN THOSE MARCHES TO THAT END KUTZOVS ACTIVITY WASDIRECTED DURING THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN FROM MOSCOW TO VLNANOT CASUALLY ORINTERMITTENTLY BUT SO CONSISTENTLY THAT HE NEVER ONCE DEVIATED FROM ITKUTZOV FELT AND KNEWNOT BY REASONING OR SCIENCE BUT WITH THE WHOLE OFHIS RUSSIAN BEINGWHAT EVERY RUSSIAN SOLDIER FELT THAT THE FRENCH WEREBEATEN THAT THE ENEMY WAS FLYING AND MUST BE DRIVEN OUT BUT AT THESAME TIME HE LIKE THE SOLDIERS REALIZED ALL THE HARDSHIP OF THIS MARCHTHE RAPIDITY OF WHICH WAS UNPARALLELED FOR SUCH A TIME OF THE YEARBUT TO THE GENERALS ESPECIALLY THE FOREIGN ONES IN THE RUSSIAN ARMYWHO WISHED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES TO ASTONISH SOMEBODY AND FOR SOMEREASON TO CAPTURE A KING OR A DUKEIT SEEMED THAT NOWWHEN ANY BATTLEMUST BE HORRIBLE AND SENSELESSWAS THE VERY TIME TO FIGHT AND

NECESSITY BUT CONSIDERED THEMSELVES HEROES ANDIMAGINED THAT THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHING A MOST NOBLE AND HONORABLEDEED THEY BLAMED KUTZOV AND SAID THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THECAMPAIGN HE HAD PREVENTED THEIR VANQUISHING NAPOLEON THAT HE THOUGHT OFNOTHING BUT SATISFYING HIS PASSIONS AND WOULD NOT ADVANCE FROM THE LINENFACTORIES BECAUSE HE WAS COMFORTABLE THERE THAT AT KRSNOE HE CHECKEDTHE ADVANCE BECAUSE ON LEARNING THAT NAPOLEON WAS THERE HE HAD QUITELOST HIS HEAD AND THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT HE HAD AN UNDERSTANDINGWITH NAPOLEON AND HAD BEEN BRIBED BY HIM AND SO ON AND SO ONNOT ONLY DID HIS CONTEMPORARIES CARRIED AWAY BY THEIR PASSIONS TALKIN THIS WAY BUT POSTERITY AND HISTORY HAVE ACCLAIMED NAPOLEON AS GRANDWHILE KUTZOV IS DESCRIBED BY FOREIGNERS AS A CRAFTY DISSOLUTE WEAKOLD

AND IN A HISTORY RECENTLY WRITTEN BY ORDEROF THE HIGHEST AUTHORITIES IT IS SAID THAT KUTZOV WAS A CUNNING COURTLIAR FRIGHTENED OF THE NAME OF NAPOLEON AND THAT BY HIS BLUNDERS ATKRSNOE AND THE BERZINA HE DEPRIVED THE RUSSIAN ARMY OF THE GLORY OFCOMPLETE VICTORY OVER THE FRENCH       HISTORY OF THE YEAR  THE CHARACTER OF KUTZOV AND     REFLECTIONS ON THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS OF THE BATTLES AT

UNSWERVINGLY DIRECTED TO A SINGLE AIM AND IT WOULD BEDIFFICULT TO IMAGINE ANY AIM MORE WORTHY OR MORE CONSONANT WITH THEWILL OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE STILL MORE DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO FINDAN INSTANCE IN

AND MYSTERIOUS TO ONE ANOTHERCHAPTER XTHE FRENCH ARMY MELTED AWAY AT THE UNIFORM RATE OF A MATHEMATICALPROGRESSION AND THAT CROSSING OF THE BERZINA ABOUT WHICH SO MUCH HASBEEN WRITTEN WAS ONLY ONE INTERMEDIATE STAGE IN ITS DESTRUCTION ANDNOT AT ALL THE DECISIVE EPISODE OF THE CAMPAIGN IF SO MUCH HAS BEENAND STILL IS WRITTEN ABOUT THE BERZINA ON THE FRENCH SIDE THIS IS ONLYBECAUSE AT THE BROKEN BRIDGE ACROSS THAT RIVER THE CALAMITIES THEIR ARMYHAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ENDURING WERE SUDDENLY CONCENTRATED AT ONE MOMENTINTO A TRAGIC SPECTACLE THAT REMAINED IN EVERY MEMORY AND ON THERUSSIAN SIDE MERELY BECAUSE IN PETERSBURGFAR FROM THE SEAT OF WARAPLAN AGAIN ONE OF PFUELS HAD BEEN DEVISED TO CATCH NAPOLEON IN ASTRATEGIC TRAP AT THE BERZINA RIVER EVERYONE ASSURED HIMSELF THAT ALLWOULD HAPPEN ACCORDING TO PLAN AND THEREFORE INSISTED THAT IT WAS JUSTTHE CROSSING OF THE BERZINA THAT DESTROYED THE FRENCH ARMY IN REALITYTHE RESULTS OF THE CROSSING WERE MUCH LESS DISASTROUS TO THE FRENCHINGUNS AND MEN LOSTTHAN KRSNOE HAD BEEN AS THE FIGURES SHOWTHE SOLE IMPORTANCE OF THE CROSSING OF THE BERZINA LIES IN THE FACTTHAT IT PLAINLY AND INDUBITABLY PROVED THE FALLACY OF ALL THE PLANS FORCUTTING OFF THE ENEMYS RETREAT AND THE SOUNDNESS OF THE ONLY POSSIBLELINE OF ACTIONTHE ONE KUTZOV AND THE GENERAL MASS OF THE ARMYDEMANDEDNAMELY SIMPLY TO FOLLOW THE ENEMY UP THE FRENCH CROWD FLEDAT A CONTINUALLY INCREASING SPEED AND ALL ITS ENERGY WAS DIRECTED TOREACHING ITS GOAL IT FLED LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLETO BLOCK ITS PATH THIS WAS SHOWN NOT SO MUCH BY THE ARRANGEMENTS ITMADE FOR CROSSING AS BY WHAT TOOK PLACE AT THE BRIDGES WHEN THE BRIDGESBROKE DOWN UNARMED SOLDIERS PEOPLE FROM MOSCOW AND WOMEN WITHCHILDREN WHO WERE WITH THE FRENCH TRANSPORT ALLCARRIED ON BY VISINERTIPRESSED FORWARD INTO BOATS AND INTO THE ICECOVERED WATER ANDDID NOT SURRENDERTHAT IMPULSE WAS REASONABLE THE CONDITION OF FUGITIVES AND OF PURSUERSWAS EQUALLY BAD AS LONG AS THEY REMAINED WITH THEIR OWN PEOPLE EACHMIGHT HOPE FOR HELP FROM HIS FELLOWS AND THE DEFINITE PLACE HE HELDAMONG THEM BUT THOSE WHO SURRENDERED WHILE REMAINING IN THE SAMEPITIFUL PLIGHT WOULD BE ON A LOWER LEVEL TO CLAIM A SHARE IN THENECESSITIES OF LIFE THE FRENCH DID NOT NEED TO BE INFORMED OF THE FACTTHAT HALF THE PRISONERSWITH WHOM THE RUSSIANS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TODOPERISHED OF COLD AND HUNGER DESPITE THEIR CAPTORS DESIRE TO SAVETHEM THEY FELT THAT IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THE MOST COMPASSIONATERUSSIAN COMMANDERS THOSE FAVORABLE TO THE FRENCHAND EVEN THE FRENCHMENIN THE RUSSIAN SERVICECOULD DO NOTHING FOR THE PRISONERS THE FRENCHPERISHED FROM THE CONDITIONS TO WHICH THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS ITSELFEXPOSED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE BREAD AND CLOTHES FROM OUR HUNGRY ANDINDISPENSABLE SOLDIERS TO GIVE TO THE FRENCH WHO THOUGH NOT HARMFUL ORHATED OR GUILTY WERE SIMPLY UNNECESSARY SOME RUSSIANS EVEN DID THATBUT THEY WERE EXCEPTIONSCERTAIN DESTRUCTION LAY BEHIND THE FRENCH BUT IN FRONT THERE WAS HOPETHEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN BURNED THERE WAS NO SALVATION SAVE IN COLLECTIVEFLIGHT AND ON THAT THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF THE FRENCH WAS CONCENTRATEDTHE FARTHER THEY FLED THE MORE WRETCHED BECAME THE PLIGHT OF THEREMNANT ESPECIALLY AFTER THE BERZINA ON WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEPETERSBURG PLAN SPECIAL HOPES HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE RUSSIANS ANDTHE KEENER GREW THE PASSIONS OF THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS WHO BLAMED ONEANOTHER AND KUTZOV MOST OF ALL ANTICIPATION THAT THE FAILURE OFTHE PETERSBURG BERZINA PLAN WOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO KUTZOV LEDTO DISSATISFACTION CONTEMPT AND RIDICULE MORE AND MORE STRONGLYEXPRESSED THE RIDICULE AND CONTEMPT WERE OF COURSE EXPRESSED IN ARESPECTFUL FORM MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ASK WHEREIN HE WASTO BLAME THEY DID NOT TALK SERIOUSLY TO HIM WHEN REPORTING TO HIM ORASKING FOR HIS SANCTION THEY APPEARED TO BE FULFILLING A REGRETTABLEFORMALITY BUT THEY WINKED BEHIND HIS BACK AND TRIED TO MISLEAD HIM ATEVERY TURNBECAUSE THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM ALL THESE PEOPLE ASSUMED THATIT WAS USELESS TO TALK TO THE OLD MAN THAT HE WOULD NEVER GRASP THEPROFUNDITY OF THEIR PLANS THAT HE WOULD ANSWER WITH HIS PHRASES WHICHTHEY THOUGHT WERE MERE PHRASES ABOUT A GOLDEN BRIDGE ABOUT THEIMPOSSIBILITY OF CROSSING THE FRONTIER WITH A CROWD OF TATTERDEMALIONSAND SO FORTH THEY HAD HEARD ALL THAT BEFORE AND ALL HE SAIDTHAT ITWAS NECESSARY TO AWAIT PROVISIONS OR THAT THE MEN HAD NO BOOTSWAS SOSIMPLE WHILE WHAT THEY PROPOSED WAS SO COMPLICATED AND CLEVER THATIT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS OLD AND STUPID AND THAT THEY THOUGH NOT INPOWER WERE COMMANDERS OF GENIUSAFTER THE

LOWERED HEAD WAS CROSSINGTHE BALLROOM WITH HIS HEAVY WADDLING GAIT HE WAS ARRESTED BY SOMEONESVOICE SAYINGYOUR SERENE HIGHNESSKUTZOV RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED FOR A LONG WHILE INTO THE EYES OFCOUNT TOLSTY WHO STOOD BEFORE HIM HOLDING A SILVER SALVER ON WHICH LAYA SMALL OBJECT KUTZOV SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OFHIMSUDDENLY HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE FLASHEDACROSS HIS PUFFY FACE AND BOWING LOW AND RESPECTFULLY HE TOOK THEOBJECT THAT LAY ON THE SALVER IT WAS THE ORDER OF ST GEORGE OF THEFIRST CLASSCHAPTER XINEXT DAY THE FIELD MARSHAL GAVE A DINNER AND BALL WHICH THE EMPERORHONORED BY HIS PRESENCE KUTZOV HAD RECEIVED THE ORDER OF ST GEORGEOF THE FIRST CLASS AND THE EMPEROR SHOWED HIM THE HIGHEST HONORS BUTEVERYONE KNEW OF THE IMPERIAL DISSATISFACTION WITH HIM THE PROPRIETIESWERE OBSERVED AND THE EMPEROR WAS THE FIRST TO SET THAT EXAMPLEBUT EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE OLD MAN WAS BLAMEWORTHY ANDGOODFORNOTHING WHEN KUTZOV CONFORMING TO A CUSTOM OF CATHERINESDAY ORDERED THE STANDARDS THAT HAD BEEN CAPTURED TO BE LOWERED AT THEEMPERORS FEET ON HIS ENTERING THE BALLROOM THE EMPEROR MADE A WRY FACEAND MUTTERED SOMETHING IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE CAUGHT THE WORDS THE OLDCOMEDIANTHE EMPERORS DISPLEASURE WITH KUTZOV WAS SPECIALLY INCREASED AT VLNABY THE FACT THAT KUTZOV EVIDENTLY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIMPORTANCE OF THE COMING CAMPAIGNWHEN ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE EMPEROR SAID TO THE OFFICERS ASSEMBLEDABOUT HIM YOU HAVE NOT ONLY SAVED RUSSIA YOU HAVE SAVED EUROPE THEYALL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WAR WAS NOT ENDEDKUTZOV ALONE WOULD NOT SEE THIS AND OPENLY EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THATNO FRESH WAR COULD IMPROVE THE POSITION OR ADD TO THE GLORY OF RUSSIABUT COULD ONLY SPOIL AND LOWER THE GLORIOUS POSITION THAT RUSSIA HADGAINED HE TRIED TO PROVE TO THE EMPEROR THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF LEVYINGFRESH TROOPS SPOKE OF THE HARDSHIPS ALREADY ENDURED BY THE PEOPLE OFTHE POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE AND SO FORTHTHIS BEING THE FIELD MARSHALS FRAME OF MIND HE WAS NATURALLY REGARDEDAS MERELY A HINDRANCE AND OBSTACLE TO THE IMPENDING WARTO AVOID UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTERS WITH THE OLD MAN THE NATURAL METHOD WASTO DO WHAT HAD BEEN DONE WITH HIM AT AUSTERLITZ AND WITH BARCLAY ATTHE BEGINNING OF THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGNTO TRANSFER THE AUTHORITY TO THEEMPEROR HIMSELF THUS CUTTING THE GROUND FROM UNDER THE COMMANDER INCHIEFS FEET WITHOUT UPSETTING THE OLD MAN BY INFORMING HIM OF THECHANGEWITH THIS OBJECT HIS STAFF WAS GRADUALLY RECONSTRUCTED AND ITS REALSTRENGTH REMOVED AND TRANSFERRED TO THE EMPEROR TOLL KONOVNTSYN ANDERMLOV

PLAYED OUT KUTZOVSPLACE WAS TAKEN BY A NEW AND NECESSARY PERFORMERTHE WAR OF  BESIDES ITS NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE DEAR TO EVERY RUSSIANHEART WAS NOW TO ASSUME ANOTHER A EUROPEAN SIGNIFICANCETHE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES FROM WEST TO EAST WAS TO BE SUCCEEDED BY AMOVEMENT OF PEOPLES FROM EAST TO WEST AND FOR THIS FRESH WAR ANOTHERLEADER WAS NECESSARY HAVING QUALITIES AND VIEWS DIFFERING FROMKUTZOVS AND ANIMATED BY DIFFERENT MOTIVESALEXANDER I WAS AS NECESSARY FOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES FROM EASTTO WEST AND FOR THE REFIXING OF NATIONAL FRONTIERS AS KUTZOV HAD BEENFOR THE SALVATION AND GLORY OF RUSSIAKUTZOV DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT EUROPE THE BALANCE OF POWER ORNAPOLEON MEANT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OFTHE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AFTER THE ENEMY HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND RUSSIA HADBEEN LIBERATED AND RAISED TO THE SUMMIT OF HER GLORY THERE WAS NOTHINGLEFT TO DO AS A RUSSIAN NOTHING REMAINED FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THENATIONAL WAR BUT TO DIE AND KUTZOV DIEDCHAPTER XIIAS GENERALLY HAPPENS PIERRE DID NOT FEEL THE FULL EFFECTS OF THEPHYSICAL PRIVATION AND STRAIN HE HAD SUFFERED AS PRISONER UNTIL AFTERTHEY WERE OVER AFTER HIS LIBERATION HE REACHED ORL AND ON THE THIRDDAY THERE WHEN PREPARING TO GO TO KIEV HE FELL ILL AND WAS LAID UPFOR THREE MONTHS HE HAD WHAT THE DOCTORS TERMED BILIOUS FEVER BUTDESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DOCTORS TREATED HIM BLED HIM AND GAVE HIMMEDICINES TO DRINK HE RECOVEREDSCARCELY ANY IMPRESSION WAS LEFT ON PIERRES MIND BY ALL THAT HAPPENEDTO HIM FROM THE TIME OF HIS RESCUE TILL HIS ILLNESS HE REMEMBEREDONLY THE DULL GRAY WEATHER NOW RAINY AND NOW SNOWY INTERNAL PHYSICALDISTRESS AND PAINS IN HIS FEET AND SIDE HE REMEMBERED A GENERALIMPRESSION OF THE MISFORTUNES AND SUFFERINGS OF PEOPLE AND OF BEINGWORRIED BY THE CURIOSITY OF OFFICERS AND GENERALS WHO QUESTIONED HIM HEALSO REMEMBERED HIS DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING A CONVEYANCE AND HORSES ANDABOVE ALL HE REMEMBERED HIS INCAPACITY TO THINK AND FEEL ALL THAT TIMEON THE DAY OF HIS RESCUE HE HAD SEEN THE BODY OF PTYA ROSTV THAT SAMEDAY HE HAD LEARNED THAT PRINCE ANDREW AFTER SURVIVING THE BATTLE OFBORODIN FOR MORE THAN A MONTH HAD RECENTLY DIED IN THE ROSTVS HOUSEAT YAROSLVL AND DENSOV WHO TOLD HIM THIS NEWS ALSO MENTIONED HLNESDEATH SUPPOSING THAT PIERRE HAD HEARD OF IT LONG BEFORE ALL THIS ATTHE TIME SEEMED MERELY STRANGE TO PIERRE HE FELT HE COULD NOT GRASP

OVERALL THE STRANGE NEW FACTS HE HAD LEARNED BUT ON REACHING ORL HEIMMEDIATELY FELL ILL WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF AFTER HIS ILLNESS HE SAWIN ATTENDANCE ON HIM TWO OF HIS SERVANTS TERNTY AND VSKA WHO HADCOME FROM MOSCOW AND ALSO HIS COUSIN THE ELDEST PRINCESS WHO HAD BEENLIVING ON HIS ESTATE AT ELTS AND HEARING OF HIS RESCUE AND ILLNESS HADCOME TO LOOK AFTER HIMIT WAS ONLY GRADUALLY DURING HIS CONVALESCENCE THAT PIERRE LOST THEIMPRESSIONS HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHSAND GOT USED TO THE IDEA THAT NO ONE WOULD OBLIGE HIM TO GO ANYWHERETOMORROW THAT NO ONE WOULD DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS WARM BED AND THAT HEWOULD BE SURE TO GET HIS DINNER TEA AND SUPPER BUT FOR A LONG TIME INHIS DREAMS HE STILL SAW HIMSELF IN THE CONDITIONS OF CAPTIVITY IN THESAME WAY LITTLE BY

MOVED UP TO HIM WITH SAVORY BEEF TEA OR WHEN HE LAY DOWN FORTHE NIGHT ON A SOFT CLEAN BED OR WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE FRENCH HADGONE AND THAT HIS WIFE WAS NO MORE OH HOW GOOD HOW SPLENDIDAND BY OLD HABIT HE ASKED HIMSELF THE QUESTION WELL AND WHAT THENWHAT AM I GOING TO DO AND HE IMMEDIATELY GAVE HIMSELF THE ANSWERWELL I SHALL LIVE AH HOW SPLENDIDTHE VERY QUESTION THAT HAD FORMERLY TORMENTED HIM THE THING HE HADCONTINUALLY SOUGHT TO FINDTHE AIM OF LIFENO LONGER EXISTED FORHIM NOW THAT SEARCH FOR THE AIM OF LIFE HAD NOT MERELY DISAPPEAREDTEMPORARILYHE FELT THAT IT NO LONGER EXISTED FOR HIM AND

SUDDENLY IN HIS CAPTIVITYHE HAD LEARNED NOT BY WORDS OR REASONING BUT BY DIRECT FEELING WHAT HISNURSE HAD TOLD HIM LONG AGO THAT GOD IS HERE AND EVERYWHERE IN HISCAPTIVITY HE HAD LEARNED THAT IN KARATEV GOD WAS GREATER MORE INFINITEAND UNFATHOMABLE THAN IN THE ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE RECOGNIZED BY THEFREEMASONS HE FELT LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER STRAINING HIS EYES TO SEE INTOTHE FAR DISTANCE FINDS WHAT HE SOUGHT AT HIS VERY FEET ALL HIS LIFEHE HAD LOOKED OVER THE HEADS OF THE MEN AROUND HIM WHEN HE SHOULD HAVEMERELY LOOKED IN FRONT OF HIM WITHOUT STRAINING HIS EYESIN THE PAST HE HAD NEVER

WHAT FOR A SIMPLE ANSWER WAS NOW ALWAYS READY IN HIS SOULBECAUSE THERE IS A GOD THAT GOD WITHOUT WHOSE WILL NOT ONE HAIR FALLSFROM A MANS HEADCHAPTER XIIIIN EXTERNAL WAYS PIERRE HAD HARDLY CHANGED AT ALL IN APPEARANCE HEWAS JUST WHAT HE USED TO BE AS BEFORE HE WAS ABSENTMINDED AND SEEMEDOCCUPIED NOT WITH WHAT WAS BEFORE HIS EYES BUT WITH SOMETHING SPECIALOF HIS OWN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS FORMER AND PRESENT SELF WAS THATFORMERLY WHEN HE DID NOT GRASP WHAT LAY BEFORE HIM OR WAS SAID TOHIM HE HAD PUCKERED HIS FOREHEAD PAINFULLY AS IF VAINLY SEEKING TODISTINGUISH SOMETHING AT A DISTANCE AT PRESENT HE STILL FORGOT WHAT WASSAID TO HIM AND STILL DID NOT SEE WHAT WAS BEFORE HIS EYES BUT HE NOWLOOKED WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND SEEMINGLY IRONIC SMILE AT WHATWAS BEFORE HIM AND LISTENED TO WHAT WAS SAID THOUGH EVIDENTLY SEEINGAND HEARING SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FORMERLY HE HAD APPEARED TO BEA KINDHEARTED BUT UNHAPPY MAN AND SO PEOPLE HAD BEEN INCLINED TO AVOIDHIM NOW A SMILE AT THE JOY OF LIFE ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HIS LIPS ANDSYMPATHY FOR OTHERS SHONE IN HIS EYES WITH A QUESTIONING LOOK AS TOWHETHER THEY WERE AS CONTENTED AS HE WAS AND PEOPLE FELT PLEASED BY HISPRESENCEPREVIOUSLY HE HAD TALKED A GREAT DEAL GREW EXCITED WHEN HE TALKED ANDSELDOM LISTENED NOW HE WAS SELDOM CARRIED AWAY IN CONVERSATION ANDKNEW HOW TO LISTEN SO THAT PEOPLE READILY TOLD HIM THEIR MOST INTIMATESECRETSTHE PRINCESS WHO HAD NEVER LIKED PIERRE AND HAD BEEN PARTICULARLYHOSTILE TO HIM SINCE SHE HAD FELT HERSELF UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO HIM AFTERTHE OLD COUNTS DEATH NOW AFTER STAYING A SHORT

NOT IN ANY WAY SEEK HERAPPROVAL HE MERELY STUDIED HER WITH INTEREST FORMERLY SHE HAD FELTTHAT HE REGARDED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE AND IRONY AND SO HAD SHRUNK INTOHERSELF AS SHE DID WITH OTHERS AND HAD SHOWN HIM ONLY THE COMBATIVE SIDEOF HER NATURE BUT NOW HE SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MOSTINTIMATE PLACES OF HER HEART AND MISTRUSTFULLY AT FIRST BUT AFTERWARDSGRATEFULLY SHE LET HIM SEE THE HIDDEN KINDLY SIDES OF HER CHARACTERTHE MOST CUNNING MAN COULD NOT HAVE CREPT INTO HER CONFIDENCE MORESUCCESSFULLY EVOKING MEMORIES OF THE BEST TIMES OF HER YOUTH ANDSHOWING SYMPATHY WITH THEM YET PIERRES CUNNING CONSISTED SIMPLY INFINDING PLEASURE IN DRAWING OUT THE HUMAN QUALITIES OF THE EMBITTEREDHARD AND IN HER OWN WAY PROUD PRINCESSYES HE IS A VERY VERY KIND MAN WHEN HE IS NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OFBAD PEOPLE BUT OF PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF THOUGHT SHEHIS SERVANTS TOOTERNTY AND VSKAIN THEIR OWN WAY NOTICED THE CHANGETHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN PIERRE THEY CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD BECOME MUCHSIMPLER TERNTY WHEN HE HAD HELPED HIM UNDRESS AND WISHED HIM GOODNIGHT OFTEN LINGERED WITH HIS MASTERS BOOTS IN HIS HANDS AND CLOTHESOVER HIS ARM TO SEE WHETHER HE WOULD NOT START A TALK AND PIERRENOTICING THAT TERNTY WANTED A CHAT GENERALLY KEPT HIM THEREWELL TELL ME NOW HOW DID YOU GET FOOD HE WOULD ASKAND TERNTY WOULD BEGIN TALKING OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW AND OFTHE OLD COUNT AND WOULD STAND FOR A LONG TIME HOLDING THE CLOTHES ANDTALKING OR SOMETIMES LISTENING TO PIERRES STORIES AND THEN WOULD GOOUT INTO THE HALL WITH A PLEASANT SENSE OF INTIMACY WITH HIS MASTER ANDAFFECTION FOR HIMTHE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED PIERRE AND VISITED HIM EVERY DAY THOUGH HECONSIDERED IT HIS DUTY AS A DOCTOR TO POSE AS A MAN WHOSE EVERY MOMENTWAS OF VALUE TO SUFFERING HUMANITY WOULD SIT FOR HOURS WITH PIERRETELLING HIM HIS FAVORITE ANECDOTES AND HIS OBSERVATIONS ON THECHARACTERS OF HIS PATIENTS IN GENERAL AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LADIESITS A PLEASURE TO TALK TO A MAN LIKE THAT HE IS NOT LIKE

FELLOW HE SAIDBUT FOR ALL THAT WILLARSKI FOUND IT PLEASANTER NOW THAN IT HAD BEENFORMERLY TO BE WITH PIERRE AND CAME TO SEE HIM EVERY DAY TO PIERRE ASHE LOOKED AT AND LISTENED TO WILLARSKI IT SEEMED STRANGE TO THINK THATHE HAD BEEN LIKE THAT HIMSELF BUT A SHORT TIME BEFOREWILLARSKI WAS A MARRIED MAN WITH A FAMILY BUSY WITH HIS FAMILY AFFAIRSHIS WIFES AFFAIRS AND HIS OFFICIAL DUTIES HE REGARDED ALL THESEOCCUPATIONS AS HINDRANCES TO LIFE AND CONSIDERED THAT THEY WERE ALLCONTEMPTIBLE BECAUSE THEIR AIM WAS THE WELFARE OF HIMSELF AND HISFAMILY MILITARY ADMINISTRATIVE POLITICAL AND MASONIC INTERESTSCONTINUALLY ABSORBED HIS ATTENTION AND PIERRE WITHOUT TRYING TOCHANGE THE OTHERS VIEWS AND WITHOUT CONDEMNING HIM BUT WITH THE QUIETJOYFUL AND AMUSED SMILE NOW HABITUAL TO HIM WAS INTERESTED IN THISSTRANGE THOUGH VERY FAMILIAR PHENOMENONTHERE WAS A NEW FEATURE IN PIERRES RELATIONS WITH WILLARSKI WITH THEPRINCESS WITH THE DOCTOR AND WITH ALL THE PEOPLE HE NOW MET WHICHGAINED FOR HIM THE GENERAL GOOD WILL THIS WAS HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OFTHE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CHANGING A MANS CONVICTIONS BY WORDS AND HISRECOGNITION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF EVERYONE THINKING FEELING AND SEEINGTHINGS EACH FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW THIS LEGITIMATE PECULIARITY OFEACH INDIVIDUAL WHICH USED TO EXCITE AND IRRITATE PIERRE NOW BECAME ABASIS OF THE SYMPATHY HE FELT FOR AND THE INTEREST HE TOOK IN OTHERPEOPLE THE DIFFERENCE AND SOMETIMES COMPLETE CONTRADICTION BETWEENMENS OPINIONS AND THEIR LIVES AND BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ANOTHER PLEASEDHIM AND DREW FROM HIM AN AMUSED AND GENTLE SMILEIN PRACTICAL MATTERS PIERRE UNEXPECTEDLY FELT WITHIN HIMSELF A CENTEROF GRAVITY HE HAD PREVIOUSLY LACKED FORMERLY ALL PECUNIARY QUESTIONSESPECIALLY REQUESTS FOR MONEY TO WHICH AS AN EXTREMELY WEALTHY MANHE WAS VERY EXPOSED PRODUCED IN HIM A STATE OF HOPELESS AGITATION ANDPERPLEXITY TO GIVE OR NOT TO GIVE HE HAD ASKED HIMSELF I HAVEIT AND HE NEEDS IT BUT SOMEONE ELSE NEEDS IT STILL MORE WHO NEEDS ITMOST AND PERHAPS THEY ARE BOTH IMPOSTORS IN THE OLD DAYS HE HAD BEENUNABLE TO FIND A WAY OUT OF ALL THESE SURMISES AND HAD GIVEN TO ALLWHO ASKED AS LONG AS HE HAD ANYTHING TO GIVE FORMERLY HE HAD BEEN IN ASIMILAR STATE OF PERPLEXITY WITH REGARD TO EVERY QUESTION CONCERNING HISPROPERTY WHEN ONE PERSON ADVISED ONE THING AND ANOTHER SOMETHING ELSENOW TO HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND THAT HE NO LONGER FELT EITHER DOUBT ORPERPLEXITY ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS THERE WAS NOW WITHIN HIM A JUDGE WHOBY SOME RULE UNKNOWN TO HIM DECIDED WHAT SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE DONEHE WAS AS INDIFFERENT AS HERETOFORE TO MONEY MATTERS BUT NOW HE FELTCERTAIN OF WHAT OUGHT AND WHAT OUGHT NOT TO BE DONE THE FIRST TIME HEHAD RECOURSE TO HIS NEW JUDGE WAS WHEN A FRENCH PRISONER A COLONELCAME TO HIM AND AFTER TALKING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIS EXPLOITSCONCLUDED BY MAKING WHAT AMOUNTED TO A DEMAND THAT PIERRE SHOULD GIVEHIM FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS TO SEND TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN PIERREREFUSED WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY OR EFFORT AND WAS AFTERWARDSSURPRISED HOW SIMPLE AND EASY HAD BEEN WHAT USED TO APPEAR SOINSURMOUNTABLY DIFFICULT AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE REFUSED THE COLONELSDEMAND HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO ARTIFICE WHENLEAVING ORL TO INDUCE THE ITALIAN OFFICER TO ACCEPT SOME MONEY OFWHICH HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN NEED A FURTHER PROOF TO PIERRE OF HIS OWNMORE SETTLED OUTLOOK ON PRACTICAL MATTERS WAS FURNISHED BY HIS DECISIONWITH REGARD TO HIS WIFES DEBTS AND TO THE REBUILDING OF HIS HOUSES INAND NEAR MOSCOWHIS HEAD STEWARD CAME TO HIM AT ORL AND PIERRE RECKONED UP WITH HIM HISDIMINISHED INCOME THE BURNING OF MOSCOW HAD COST HIM ACCORDING TO THEHEAD STEWARDS CALCULATION ABOUT TWO MILLION RUBLESTO CONSOLE PIERRE FOR THESE LOSSES THE HEAD STEWARD GAVE HIM AN ESTIMATESHOWING THAT DESPITE THESE LOSSES HIS INCOME WOULD NOT BE DIMINISHED BUTWOULD EVEN BE INCREASED IF HE REFUSED TO PAY HIS WIFES DEBTS WHICH HEWAS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO MEET AND DID NOT REBUILD HIS MOSCOW HOUSEAND THE COUNTRY HOUSE ON HIS MOSCOW ESTATE WHICH HAD COST HIM EIGHTYTHOUSAND RUBLES A YEAR AND BROUGHT IN NOTHINGYES OF COURSE THATS TRUE SAID PIERRE WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE IDONT NEED ALL THAT AT ALL BY BEING RUINED I HAVE BECOME MUCH RICHERBUT IN JANUARY SAVLICH CAME FROM MOSCOW AND GAVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF THESTATE OF THINGS THERE AND SPOKE OF THE ESTIMATE AN ARCHITECT HAD MADEOF THE COST OF REBUILDING THE TOWN AND COUNTRY

STEWARDS PROPOSALS WHICH HAD SOPLEASED HIM WERE WRONG AND THAT HE MUST GO TO PETERSBURG AND SETTLE HISWIFES AFFAIRS AND MUST REBUILD IN MOSCOW WHY THIS WAS NECESSARY HEDID NOT KNOW BUT HE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS NECESSARY HIS INCOMEWOULD BE REDUCED BY THREE FOURTHS BUT HE FELT IT MUST BE DONEWILLARSKI WAS GOING TO MOSCOW AND THEY AGREED TO TRAVEL TOGETHERDURING THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS CONVALESCENCE IN ORL PIERRE HADEXPERIENCED A FEELING OF JOY FREEDOM AND LIFE BUT WHEN DURING HISJOURNEY HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE OPEN WORLD AND SAW HUNDREDS OF NEWFACES THAT FEELING WAS INTENSIFIED THROUGHOUT HIS JOURNEY HE FELT LIKEA SCHOOLBOY ON HOLIDAY EVERYONETHE STAGECOACH DRIVER THE POSTHOUSEOVERSEERS THE PEASANTS ON THE ROADS AND IN THE VILLAGESHAD A NEWSIGNIFICANCE FOR HIM THE PRESENCE AND REMARKS OF WILLARSKI WHOCONTINUALLY DEPLORED THE IGNORANCE AND POVERTY OF RUSSIA AND ITSBACKWARDNESS COMPARED WITH EUROPE ONLY HEIGHTENED PIERRES PLEASUREWHERE WILLARSKI SAW DEADNESS PIERRE SAW AN EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH ANDVITALITYTHE STRENGTH WHICH IN THAT VAST SPACE AMID THE SNOWS MAINTAINEDTHE LIFE OF THIS ORIGINAL PECULIAR AND UNIQUE PEOPLE HE DID NOTCONTRADICT WILLARSKI AND EVEN SEEMED TO AGREE WITH HIMAN APPARENTAGREEMENT BEING THE SIMPLEST WAY TO AVOID DISCUSSIONS THAT COULD LEAD TONOTHINGAND HE SMILED JOYFULLY AS HE LISTENED TO HIMCHAPTER XIVIT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN WHY AND WHITHER ANTS WHOSE HEAPHAS BEEN DESTROYED ARE HURRYING SOME FROM THE HEAP DRAGGING BITS OFRUBBISH LARVAE AND CORPSES OTHERS BACK TO THE HEAP OR WHY THEYJOSTLE OVERTAKE ONE ANOTHER AND FIGHT AND IT WOULD BE EQUALLYDIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSED THE RUSSIANS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THEFRENCH TO THRONG TO THE PLACE THAT HAD FORMERLY BEEN MOSCOW BUT WHENWE WATCH THE ANTS ROUND THEIR RUINED HEAP THE TENACITY ENERGY ANDIMMENSE NUMBER OF THE DELVING INSECTS PROVE THAT DESPITE THE DESTRUCTIONOF THE HEAP SOMETHING INDESTRUCTIBLE WHICH THOUGH INTANGIBLE IS THEREAL STRENGTH OF THE COLONY STILL

US CONTINUED TO OPERATETHOUGH THE SURFACE OF THE SEA OF HISTORY SEEMED MOTIONLESS THE MOVEMENTOF HUMANITY WENT ON AS UNCEASINGLY AS THE FLOW OF TIME VARIOUS GROUPSOF PEOPLE FORMED AND DISSOLVED THE COMING FORMATION AND DISSOLUTION OFKINGDOMS AND DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLES WAS IN COURSE OF PREPARATIONTHE SEA OF HISTORY WAS NOT DRIVEN SPASMODICALLY FROM SHORE TO SHORE ASPREVIOUSLY IT WAS SEETHING IN

CONDUCED TO PROGRESS OR TO REACTIONACCORDING TO THEIR ACCOUNTS A REACTION TOOK PLACE AT THAT TIME IN RUSSIAALSO AND THE CHIEF CULPRIT WAS ALEXANDER I THE SAME MAN WHO ACCORDINGTO THEM WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE LIBERAL MOVEMENT AT THE COMMENCEMENTOF HIS REIGN BEING THE SAVIOR OF RUSSIATHERE IS NO ONE IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE NOW FROM SCHOOLBOY ESSAYIST TOLEARNED HISTORIAN WHO DOES NOT THROW HIS LITTLE STONE AT ALEXANDER FORTHINGS HE DID WRONG AT THIS PERIOD OF HIS REIGNHE OUGHT TO HAVE ACTED IN THIS WAY AND IN THAT WAY IN THIS CASE HE DIDWELL AND IN THAT CASE BADLY HE BEHAVED ADMIRABLY AT THE BEGINNING OFHIS REIGN AND DURING  BUT ACTED BADLY BY GIVING A CONSTITUTIONTO POLAND FORMING THE HOLY ALLIANCE ENTRUSTING POWER TO ARAKCHEVFAVORING GOLTSYN AND MYSTICISM AND AFTERWARDS SHISHKV AND PHOTIUSHE ALSO ACTED BADLY BY CONCERNING HIMSELF WITH THE ACTIVE ARMY ANDDISBANDING THE SEMNOV REGIMENTIT WOULD TAKE A DOZEN PAGES TO ENUMERATE ALL THE REPROACHES THEHISTORIANS ADDRESS TO HIM BASED ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS GOOD FORHUMANITYWHAT DO THESE REPROACHES MEANDO NOT THE VERY ACTIONS FOR WHICH THE HISTORIANS PRAISE ALEXANDER ITHE LIBERAL ATTEMPTS AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN HIS STRUGGLE WITHNAPOLEON THE FIRMNESS HE DISPLAYED IN  AND THE CAMPAIGN OF FLOW FROM THE SAME SOURCESTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS BIRTH EDUCATIONAND LIFETHAT MADE HIS PERSONALITY WHAT IT WAS AND FROM WHICH THEACTIONS FOR WHICH THEY BLAME HIM THE HOLY ALLIANCE THE RESTORATION OFPOLAND AND THE REACTION OF  AND LATER ALSO FLOWEDIN WHAT DOES THE SUBSTANCE OF THOSE REPROACHES LIEIT LIES IN THE FACT THAT AN HISTORIC CHARACTER LIKE ALEXANDER ISTANDING ON THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PINNACLE OF HUMAN POWER WITH THEBLINDING LIGHT OF HISTORY FOCUSED UPON HIM A CHARACTER EXPOSED TO THOSESTRONGEST OF ALL INFLUENCES THE INTRIGUES FLATTERY AND SELFDECEPTIONINSEPARABLE FROM POWER A CHARACTER WHO AT EVERY MOMENT OF HIS LIFEFELT A RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND NOTA FICTITIOUS BUT A LIVE CHARACTER WHO LIKE EVERY MAN HAD HIS PERSONALHABITS PASSIONS AND IMPULSES TOWARD GOODNESS BEAUTY AND TRUTHTHATTHIS CHARACTERTHOUGH NOT LACKING IN VIRTUE THE HISTORIANS DO NOTACCUSE HIM OF THATHAD NOT THE SAME CONCEPTION OF THE WELFARE OFHUMANITY FIFTY YEARS AGO AS A PRESENTDAY PROFESSOR WHO FROM HISYOUTH UPWARDS HAS BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LEARNING THAT IS WITH BOOKS ANDLECTURES AND WITH TAKING NOTES FROM THEMBUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT FIFTY YEARS AGO ALEXANDER I WAS MISTAKEN INHIS VIEW OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WE MUST INEVITABLY ASSUME THATTHE HISTORIAN WHO JUDGES ALEXANDER WILL ALSO AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOMETIME TURN OUT TO BE MISTAKEN IN HIS VIEW OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR HUMANITYTHIS ASSUMPTION IS ALL THE MORE NATURAL AND INEVITABLE BECAUSE WATCHINGTHE MOVEMENT OF HISTORY WE SEE THAT EVERY YEAR AND WITH EACH NEWWRITER OPINION AS TO WHAT IS GOOD FOR MANKIND CHANGES SO THAT WHATONCE SEEMED GOOD TEN YEARS LATER SEEMS BAD AND VICE VERSA AND WHAT ISMORE WE FIND AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME QUITE CONTRADICTORY VIEWS AS TOWHAT IS BAD AND WHAT IS GOOD IN HISTORY SOME PEOPLE REGARD GIVING ACONSTITUTION TO POLAND AND FORMING THE HOLY ALLIANCE AS PRAISEWORTHY INALEXANDER WHILE OTHERS REGARD IT AS BLAMEWORTHYTHE ACTIVITY OF ALEXANDER OR OF NAPOLEON CANNOT BE CALLED USEFUL ORHARMFUL FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FOR WHAT IT WAS USEFUL OR HARMFULIF THAT ACTIVITY DISPLEASES SOMEBODY THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE IT DOESNOT AGREE WITH HIS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOOD WHETHER THEPRESERVATION OF MY FATHERS HOUSE IN MOSCOW OR THE GLORY OF THE RUSSIANARMS OR THE PROSPERITY OF THE PETERSBURG AND OTHER UNIVERSITIES OR THEFREEDOM OF POLAND OR THE GREATNESS OF RUSSIA OR THE BALANCE OF POWER INEUROPE OR A CERTAIN KIND OF EUROPEAN CULTURE CALLED PROGRESS APPEARTO ME TO BE GOOD OR BAD I MUST ADMIT THAT BESIDES THESE THINGS THEACTION OF EVERY HISTORIC CHARACTER HAS OTHER MORE GENERAL PURPOSESINACCESSIBLE TO MEBUT LET US ASSUME THAT WHAT IS CALLED SCIENCE CAN HARMONIZE ALLCONTRADICTIONS AND POSSESSES AN UNCHANGING STANDARD OF GOOD AND BAD BYWHICH TO TRY HISTORIC CHARACTERS AND EVENTS LET US SAY THAT ALEXANDERCOULD HAVE DONE EVERYTHING DIFFERENTLY LET US SAY THAT WITH GUIDANCEFROM THOSE WHO BLAME HIM AND WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THEMOVEMENT OF HUMANITY HE MIGHT HAVE ARRANGED MATTERS ACCORDING TOTHE PROGRAM HIS PRESENT ACCUSERS WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIMOF NATIONALITYFREEDOM EQUALITY AND PROGRESS THESE I THINK COVER THE GROUND LETUS ASSUME THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS POSSIBLE AND HAD THEN BEEN FORMULATEDAND THAT ALEXANDER HAD ACTED ON IT WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BECOME OF THEACTIVITY OF ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE TENDENCY THAT THEN PREVAILED INTHE GOVERNMENTAN ACTIVITY THAT IN THE OPINION OF THE HISTORIANS WASGOOD AND BENEFICENT THEIR ACTIVITY WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED THERE WOULDHAVE BEEN NO LIFE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHINGIF WE ADMIT THAT HUMAN LIFE CAN BE RULED BY REASON THE POSSIBILITY OFLIFE IS DESTROYEDCHAPTER IIIF WE ASSUME AS THE HISTORIANS DO THAT GREAT MEN LEAD HUMANITY TO THEATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN ENDSTHE GREATNESS OF RUSSIA OR OF FRANCETHE BALANCE OF POWER IN EUROPE THE DIFFUSION OF THE IDEAS OF THEREVOLUTION GENERAL PROGRESS OR ANYTHING ELSETHEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLETO EXPLAIN THE FACTS OF HISTORY WITHOUT INTRODUCING THE CONCEPTIONS OFCHANCE AND GENIUSIF THE AIM OF THE EUROPEAN WARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTHCENTURY HAD BEEN THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF RUSSIA THAT AIM MIGHT HAVE BEENACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ALL THE PRECEDING WARS AND WITHOUT THE INVASION IFTHE AIM WAS THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF FRANCE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTAINEDWITHOUT THE REVOLUTION AND WITHOUT THE EMPIRE IF THE AIM WAS THEDISSEMINATION OF IDEAS THE PRINTING PRESS COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THATMUCH BETTER THAN WARFARE IF THE AIM WAS THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATIONIT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF DIFFUSING CIVILIZATIONMORE EXPEDIENT THAN BY THE DESTRUCTION OF WEALTH AND OF HUMAN LIVESWHY DID IT HAPPEN IN THIS AND NOT IN SOME OTHER WAYBECAUSE IT HAPPENED SO CHANCE CREATED THE SITUATION GENIUS UTILIZEDIT SAYS HISTORYBUT WHAT IS CHANCE WHAT IS GENIUSTHE WORDS CHANCE AND GENIUS DO NOT DENOTE ANY REALLY EXISTING THING ANDTHEREFORE CANNOT BE DEFINED THOSE WORDS ONLY DENOTE A CERTAIN STAGE OFUNDERSTANDING OF PHENOMENA I DO NOT KNOW WHY A CERTAIN EVENT OCCURS ITHINK THAT I CANNOT KNOW IT SO I DO NOT TRY TO KNOW IT AND I TALK ABOUTCHANCE I SEE A FORCE

IN AFRICA IN PRUSSIA IN AUSTRIA IN SPAINAND IN RUSSIAAND THAT THE MOVEMENTS FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST AND FROMTHE EAST TO THE WEST FORM THE ESSENCE AND PURPOSE OF THESE EVENTS ANDNOT ONLY SHALL WE HAVE NO NEED TO SEE EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AND GENIUS INNAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER BUT WE SHALL BE UNABLE TO CONSIDER THEM TOBE ANYTHING BUT LIKE OTHER MEN AND WE SHALL NOT BE OBLIGED TO HAVERECOURSE TO CHANCE FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THOSE SMALL EVENTS WHICH MADETHESE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WERE BUT IT WILL BE CLEAR THAT ALL THOSE SMALLEVENTS WERE INEVITABLEBY DISCARDING A CLAIM TO KNOWLEDGE OF THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE WE SHALLCLEARLY PERCEIVE THAT JUST AS ONE CANNOT IMAGINE A BLOSSOM OR SEED FORANY SINGLE PLANT BETTER SUITED TO IT THAN THOSE IT PRODUCES SO IT ISIMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE ANY TWO PEOPLE MORE

EXTRAORDINARY CLEARNESS AND RAPIDITYUNDERSTANDING AND EXPRESSING EACH OTHERS THOUGHTS IN WAYS CONTRARY TOALL RULES OF LOGIC WITHOUT PREMISES DEDUCTIONS OR CONCLUSIONS AND INA QUITE PECULIAR WAY NATSHA WAS SO USED TO THIS KIND OF TALK WITH HERHUSBAND THAT FOR HER IT WAS THE SUREST SIGN OF SOMETHING BEING WRONGBETWEEN THEM IF PIERRE FOLLOWED A LINE OF LOGICAL REASONING WHEN HEBEGAN PROVING ANYTHING OR TALKING ARGUMENTATIVELY AND CALMLY AND SHELED ON BY HIS EXAMPLE BEGAN TO DO THE SAME SHE KNEW THAT THEY WERE ONTHE VERGE OF A QUARRELFROM THE MOMENT THEY WERE ALONE AND NATSHA CAME UP TO HIM WITHWIDEOPEN HAPPY EYES AND QUICKLY SEIZING HIS HEAD PRESSED IT TO HERBOSOM SAYING NOW YOU ARE ALL MINE MINE YOU WONT ESCAPEFROM THATMOMENT THIS CONVERSATION BEGAN CONTRARY TO ALL THE LAWS OF LOGIC ANDCONTRARY TO THEM BECAUSE QUITE DIFFERENT SUBJECTS WERE TALKED ABOUT ATONE AND THE SAME TIME THIS SIMULTANEOUS DISCUSSION OF MANY TOPICS DIDNOT PREVENT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING BUT ON THE CONTRARY WAS THE SURESTSIGN THAT THEY FULLY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHERJUST AS IN A DREAM WHEN ALL IS UNCERTAIN UNREASONING ANDCONTRADICTORY EXCEPT THE FEELING THAT GUIDES THE DREAM SO IN THISINTERCOURSE CONTRARY TO ALL LAWS OF REASON THE WORDS THEMSELVES WERENOT CONSECUTIVE AND CLEAR BUT ONLY THE FEELING THAT PROMPTED THEMNATSHA SPOKE TO PIERRE ABOUT HER BROTHERS LIFE AND DOINGS OF HOW SHEHAD SUFFERED AND LACKED LIFE DURING HIS OWN ABSENCE AND OF HOW SHEWAS FONDER THAN EVER OF MARY AND HOW MARY WAS IN EVERY WAY BETTER THANHERSELF IN SAYING THIS NATSHA WAS SINCERE IN ACKNOWLEDGING MARYSSUPERIORITY BUT AT THE SAME TIME BY SAYING IT SHE MADE A DEMAND ONPIERRE THAT HE SHOULD ALL THE SAME PREFER HER TO MARY AND TO ALLOTHER WOMEN AND THAT NOW ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING SEEN MANY WOMEN INPETERSBURG HE SHOULD TELL HER SO AFRESHPIERRE ANSWERING NATSHAS WORDS TOLD HER HOW INTOLERABLE IT HAD BEENFOR HIM TO MEET LADIES AT DINNERS AND BALLS IN PETERSBURGI HAVE QUITE LOST THE KNACK OF TALKING TO LADIES HE SAID IT

ACCOMPLISHENDS THAT WERE PREDESTINEDFOR THE ANCIENTS THESE QUESTIONS WERE SOLVED BY A BELIEF IN THE DIRECTPARTICIPATION OF THE DEITY IN HUMAN AFFAIRSMODERN HISTORY IN THEORY REJECTS BOTH THESE PRINCIPLESIT WOULD SEEM THAT HAVING REJECTED THE BELIEF OF THE ANCIENTS IN MANSSUBJECTION TO THE DEITY AND IN A PREDETERMINED AIM TOWARD WHICH NATIONSARE LED MODERN HISTORY SHOULD STUDY NOT THE

HASOBLIGED THE HISTORIANS AFTER THEY HAD APPARENTLY REJECTED THE DIVINEAUTHORITY OF THE KINGS AND THE FATE OF THE ANCIENTS TO REACH THE SAMECONCLUSION BY ANOTHER ROAD THAT IS TO RECOGNIZE  NATIONS GUIDEDBY INDIVIDUAL MEN AND  THE EXISTENCE OF A KNOWN AIM TO WHICH THESENATIONS AND HUMANITY AT LARGE ARE TENDINGAT THE BASIS OF THE WORKS OF ALL THE MODERN HISTORIANS FROM GIBBON TOBUCKLE DESPITE THEIR SEEMING DISAGREEMENTS AND THE APPARENT NOVELTY OFTHEIR OUTLOOKS LIE THOSE TWO OLD UNAVOIDABLE ASSUMPTIONSIN THE FIRST PLACE THE HISTORIAN DESCRIBES THE ACTIVITY OF INDIVIDUALSWHO IN HIS OPINION

SO THESE ARE THE INSTINCTIVE PLAIN ANDMOST LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS HUMANITY ASKS ITSELF WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS THEMONUMENTS AND TRADITION OF THAT PERIODFOR A REPLY TO THESE QUESTIONS THE COMMON SENSE OF

REPLYING TO THESE QUESTIONS SAYS YOU WANT TO KNOW WHATTHIS MOVEMENT MEANS WHAT CAUSED IT AND WHAT FORCE PRODUCED THESEEVENTS THEN LISTENLOUIS XIV WAS A VERY PROUD AND SELFCONFIDENT MAN HE HAD SUCH AND

MOREOVER CERTAINMEN WROTE SOME BOOKS AT THAT TIME AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURYTHERE WERE A COUPLE OF DOZEN MEN IN PARIS WHO BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT ALLMEN BEING FREE AND EQUAL THIS CAUSED PEOPLE ALL OVER FRANCE TO BEGINTO SLASH AT AND DROWN ONE ANOTHER THEY KILLED THE KING AND MANY OTHERPEOPLE AT THAT TIME THERE WAS IN FRANCE A MAN OF GENIUSNAPOLEON HECONQUERED EVERYBODY EVERYWHERETHAT IS HE KILLED MANY PEOPLE BECAUSEHE WAS A GREAT GENIUS AND FOR SOME REASON HE WENT TO KILL AFRICANS ANDKILLED THEM SO WELL AND WAS SO CUNNING AND WISE THAT WHEN HE RETURNED TOFRANCE HE ORDERED EVERYBODY TO OBEY HIM AND THEY ALL OBEYED HIM HAVINGBECOME AN EMPEROR HE AGAIN WENT OUT TO KILL PEOPLE IN ITALY AUSTRIAAND PRUSSIA AND THERE TOO HE KILLED A GREAT MANY IN RUSSIA THEREWAS AN EMPEROR ALEXANDER WHO DECIDED TO RESTORE ORDER IN EUROPE ANDTHEREFORE FOUGHT AGAINST NAPOLEON IN  HE SUDDENLY MADE FRIENDSWITH HIM BUT IN  THEY AGAIN QUARRELED AND AGAIN BEGAN KILLING MANYPEOPLE NAPOLEON LED SIX HUNDRED

MADE THE NATIONS HAPPY OR UNHAPPY SUDDENLY THEDIPLOMATISTS AND MONARCHS NEARLY QUARRELED AND WERE ON THE POINT OFAGAIN ORDERING THEIR ARMIES TO KILL ONE ANOTHER BUT JUST THEN NAPOLEONARRIVED IN FRANCE WITH A BATTALION AND THE FRENCH WHO HAD BEEN HATINGHIM IMMEDIATELY ALL SUBMITTED TO HIM BUT THE ALLIED MONARCHS WEREANGRY AT THIS AND WENT TO FIGHT THE FRENCH ONCE MORE AND THEY DEFEATEDTHE GENIUS NAPOLEON AND SUDDENLY RECOGNIZING HIM AS A BRIGAND SENT HIMTO THE ISLAND OF ST HELENA AND THE EXILE SEPARATED FROM THE BELOVEDFRANCE SO DEAR TO HIS HEART DIED A LINGERING DEATH ON THAT ROCK ANDBEQUEATHED HIS GREAT DEEDS TO POSTERITY BUT IN EUROPE A REACTIONOCCURRED AND THE SOVEREIGNS ONCE AGAIN ALL BEGAN TO OPPRESS THEIRSUBJECTSIT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS IS IRONICA CARICATURE OF THEHISTORICAL ACCOUNTS ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A VERY MILD EXPRESSION OFTHE CONTRADICTORY REPLIES NOT MEETING THE QUESTIONS WHICH ALL THEHISTORIANS GIVE FROM THE COMPILERS OF MEMOIRS AND THE HISTORIESOF SEPARATE STATES TO THE WRITERS OF GENERAL HISTORIES AND THE NEWHISTORIES OF THE CULTURE OF THAT PERIODTHE STRANGENESS AND ABSURDITY OF THESE REPLIES ARISE FROM THE FACT THATMODERN HISTORY LIKE A DEAF MAN ANSWERS QUESTIONS NO ONE HAS ASKEDIF THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY BE TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OFHUMANITY AND OF THE PEOPLES THE FIRST QUESTIONIN THE ABSENCE OF AREPLY TO WHICH ALL THE REST WILL BE INCOMPREHENSIBLEIS WHAT IS THEPOWER THAT MOVES PEOPLES TO THIS MODERN HISTORY LABORIOUSLY REPLIESEITHER THAT NAPOLEON WAS A GREAT GENIUS OR THAT LOUIS XIV WAS VERYPROUD OR THAT CERTAIN WRITERS WROTE CERTAIN BOOKSALL THAT MAY BE SO AND MANKIND IS READY TO AGREE WITH IT BUT IT IS NOTWHAT WAS ASKED ALL THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF WE RECOGNIZED A DIVINEPOWER BASED ON ITSELF AND ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY DIRECTING ITS NATIONSTHROUGH NAPOLEONS LOUISES AND WRITERS BUT WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE SUCHA POWER AND THEREFORE BEFORE SPEAKING ABOUT NAPOLEONS LOUISES ANDAUTHORS WE OUGHT TO BE SHOWN THE CONNECTION EXISTING BETWEEN THESE MENAND THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONSIF INSTEAD OF A DIVINE POWER SOME OTHER FORCE HAS APPEARED IT SHOULDBE EXPLAINED IN WHAT THIS NEW FORCE CONSISTS FOR THE WHOLE INTEREST OFHISTORY LIES PRECISELY IN THAT FORCEHISTORY SEEMS TO ASSUME THAT THIS FORCE IS SELFEVIDENT AND KNOWN TOEVERYONE BUT IN SPITE OF EVERY DESIRE TO REGARD IT AS KNOWN

NATIONSBIOGRAPHICAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF SEPARATE NATIONS UNDERSTANDTHIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS IN THEIR NARRATIONEVENTS OCCUR SOLELY BY THE WILL OF A NAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER OR INGENERAL OF THE PERSONS THEY DESCRIBE THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THIS KINDOF HISTORIAN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT FORCE CAUSES EVENTS TO HAPPEN ARESATISFACTORY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE IS BUT ONE HISTORIAN TO EACH EVENTAS SOON AS HISTORIANS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES AND TENDENCIES BEGINTO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALLMEANING FOR THIS FORCE IS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL NOT ONLY DIFFERENTLYBUT OFTEN IN QUITE CONTRADICTORY WAYS ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT ANEVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEONS POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BYALEXANDERS A THIRD THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE POWER OF SOME OTHER PERSONBESIDES THIS HISTORIANS OF THAT KIND CONTRADICT EACH OTHER EVENIN THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE FORCE ON WHICH THE AUTHORITY OF SOMEPARTICULAR PERSON WAS BASED THIERS A BONAPARTIST SAYS THAT NAPOLEONSPOWER WAS BASED ON HIS VIRTUE AND GENIUS LANFREY A REPUBLICAN SAYS ITWAS BASED ON HIS TRICKERY AND DECEPTION OF THE PEOPLE SO THE HISTORIANSOF THIS CLASS BY MUTUALLY DESTROYING ONE ANOTHERS POSITIONS DESTROYTHE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS AND FURNISH NOREPLY TO HISTORYS ESSENTIAL QUESTIONWRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY WHO DEAL WITH ALL THE NATIONS SEEM TORECOGNIZE HOW ERRONEOUS IS THE SPECIALIST HISTORIANS VIEW OF THE FORCEWHICH PRODUCES EVENTS THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS A POWER INHERENT INHEROES AND RULERS BUT AS THE RESULTANT OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VARIOUSLYDIRECTED FORCES IN DESCRIBING A WAR OR THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE AGENERAL HISTORIAN LOOKS FOR THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT NOT IN THE POWEROF ONE MAN BUT IN THE INTERACTION OF MANY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THEEVENTACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE POWER OF HISTORICAL PERSONAGES REPRESENTEDAS THE PRODUCT OF MANY FORCES CAN NO LONGER IT WOULD SEEM BE REGARDEDAS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS YET IN MOST CASES UNIVERSALHISTORIANS STILL EMPLOY THE CONCEPTION OF POWER AS A FORCE THAT ITSELFPRODUCES EVENTS AND TREAT IT AS THEIR CAUSE IN THEIR EXPOSITION ANHISTORIC CHARACTER IS

REVOLUTION RESULTINGFROM THE DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF MAN OR THE VERY CRUEL WARS ANDEXECUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE PREACHING OF LOVEBUT EVEN ADMITTING AS CORRECT ALL THE CUNNINGLY DEVISED ARGUMENTS WITHWHICH THESE HISTORIES ARE FILLEDADMITTING THAT NATIONS ARE GOVERNED BYSOME UNDEFINED FORCE CALLED AN IDEAHISTORYS ESSENTIAL QUESTION STILLREMAINS UNANSWERED AND TO THE FORMER POWER OF MONARCHS AND TO THEINFLUENCE OF ADVISERS AND OTHER PEOPLE INTRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSALHISTORIANS ANOTHER NEWER FORCETHE IDEAIS ADDED THE CONNECTION OFWHICH WITH THE MASSES NEEDS EXPLANATION IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTANDTHAT NAPOLEON HAD POWER AND SO EVENTS OCCURRED WITH SOME EFFORT ONE MAYEVEN CONCEIVE THAT NAPOLEON TOGETHER WITH OTHER INFLUENCES WAS THE CAUSEOF AN EVENT BUT HOW A BOOK LE CONTRAT SOCIAL HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKINGFRENCHMEN BEGIN TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT ANEXPLANATION OF THE CAUSAL NEXUS OF THIS NEW FORCE WITH THE EVENTUNDOUBTEDLY SOME RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN ALL WHO LIVE CONTEMPORANEOUSLYAND SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INTELLECTUALACTIVITY OF MEN AND THEIR HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS JUST AS SUCH ACONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCEHANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE BUT WHY INTELLECTUALACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED BY THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE TO BE THE CAUSE OREXPRESSION OF THE WHOLE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT IS HARD TO UNDERSTANDONLY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HAVE LED THE HISTORIANS TO SUCHA CONCLUSION  THAT HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY LEARNED MEN AND SO IT ISNATURAL AND AGREEABLE FOR THEM TO THINK THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR CLASSSUPPLIES THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ALL HUMANITY JUST AS A SIMILARBELIEF IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE TO TRADERS AGRICULTURISTS AND SOLDIERSIF THEY DO NOT EXPRESS IT THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE TRADERS AND SOLDIERSDO NOT WRITE HISTORY AND  THAT SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY ENLIGHTENMENTCIVILIZATION CULTURE IDEAS ARE ALL INDISTINCT INDEFINITE CONCEPTIONSUNDER WHOSE BANNER IT IS VERY EASY TO USE WORDS HAVING A STILL LESSDEFINITE MEANING AND WHICH CAN THEREFORE BE READILY INTRODUCED INTO ANYTHEORYBUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE INTRINSIC QUALITY OF HISTORIES OF THIS KINDWHICH MAY POSSIBLY EVEN BE OF USE TO SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING THEHISTORIES OF CULTURE TO WHICH ALL GENERAL HISTORIES TEND MORE AND MORETO APPROXIMATE ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM THE FACT THAT AFTER SERIOUSLYAND MINUTELY EXAMINING VARIOUS RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHIC AND POLITICALDOCTRINES AS CAUSES OF EVENTS AS SOON AS THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE ANACTUAL HISTORIC EVENT SUCH AS THE CAMPAIGN OF  FOR INSTANCE THEYINVOLUNTARILY DESCRIBE IT AS RESULTING FROM AN EXERCISE OF POWERAND SAYPLAINLY THAT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF NAPOLEONS WILL SPEAKING SO THEHISTORIANS OF CULTURE INVOLUNTARILY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES AND SHOW THATTHE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS INHISTORY AND THAT HISTORY CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY INTRODUCING A POWERWHICH THEY APPARENTLY DO NOT RECOGNIZECHAPTER IIIA LOCOMOTIVE IS MOVING SOMEONE ASKS WHAT MOVES IT A PEASANT SAYSTHE DEVIL MOVES IT ANOTHER MAN SAYS THE LOCOMOTIVE MOVES BECAUSE ITSWHEELS GO ROUND A THIRD ASSERTS THAT THE CAUSE OF ITS MOVEMENT LIES INTHE SMOKE WHICH THE WIND CARRIES AWAYTHE PEASANT IS IRREFUTABLE HE HAS DEVISED A COMPLETE EXPLANATION TOREFUTE HIM SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE IS NO DEVILOR ANOTHER PEASANT WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE DEVILBUT A GERMAN WHO MOVES THE LOCOMOTIVE ONLY THEN AS A RESULT OF THECONTRADICTION WILL THEY SEE THAT THEY ARE BOTH WRONG BUT THE MAN WHOSAYS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHEELS IS THE CAUSE REFUTES HIMSELF FORHAVING ONCE BEGUN TO ANALYZE HE OUGHT TO GO ON AND EXPLAIN FURTHER WHYTHE WHEELS GO ROUND AND TILL HE HAS REACHED THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF THEMOVEMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE IN THE PRESSURE OF STEAM IN THE BOILER HEHAS NO RIGHT TO STOP IN HIS SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE THE MAN WHO EXPLAINSTHE MOVEMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE BY THE SMOKE THAT IS CARRIED BACK HASNOTICED THAT THE WHEELS DO NOT SUPPLY AN EXPLANATION AND HAS TAKEN THEFIRST SIGN THAT OCCURS TO HIM AND IN HIS TURN HAS OFFERED THAT AS ANEXPLANATIONTHE ONLY CONCEPTION THAT CAN EXPLAIN THE MOVEMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE ISTHAT OF A FORCE COMMENSURATE WITH THE MOVEMENT OBSERVEDTHE ONLY CONCEPTION THAT CAN EXPLAIN THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLES IS THATOF SOME FORCE COMMENSURATE WITH THE WHOLE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLESYET TO SUPPLY THIS CONCEPTION VARIOUS HISTORIANS TAKE FORCES OFDIFFERENT KINDS ALL OF WHICH ARE INCOMMENSURATE WITH THE MOVEMENTOBSERVED SOME SEE IT AS A FORCE DIRECTLY INHERENT IN HEROES AS THEPEASANT SEES THE DEVIL IN THE LOCOMOTIVE OTHERS AS A FORCE RESULTINGFROM SEVERAL OTHER FORCES LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHEELS OTHERS AGAINAS AN INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCE LIKE THE SMOKE THAT IS BLOWN AWAYSO LONG AS HISTORIES ARE WRITTEN OF SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS WHETHERCAESARS ALEXANDERS LUTHERS OR VOLTAIRES AND NOT THE HISTORIESOF ALL ABSOLUTELY ALL THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN AN EVENT IT IS QUITEIMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY WITHOUT THE CONCEPTIONOF A FORCE COMPELLING MEN TO DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TOWARD A CERTAIN ENDAND THE ONLY SUCH CONCEPTION KNOWN TO HISTORIANS IS THAT OF POWERTHIS CONCEPTION IS THE ONE HANDLE BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MATERIAL OFHISTORY AS AT PRESENT EXPOUNDED CAN BE DEALT WITH AND ANYONE WHOBREAKS THAT HANDLE OFF AS BUCKLE DID WITHOUT FINDING SOME OTHER METHODOF TREATING HISTORICAL MATERIAL MERELY DEPRIVES HIMSELF OF THE ONEPOSSIBLE WAY OF DEALING WITH IT THE NECESSITY OF THE CONCEPTION OFPOWER AS AN EXPLANATION OF HISTORICAL EVENTS IS BEST DEMONSTRATED BYTHE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF CULTURE THEMSELVES FOR THEYPROFESSEDLY REJECT THAT CONCEPTION BUT INEVITABLY HAVE RECOURSE TO IT ATEVERY STEPIN DEALING WITH HUMANITYS INQUIRY THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY UP TO NOWIS LIKE MONEY IN CIRCULATIONPAPER MONEY AND COIN THE BIOGRAPHIES ANDSPECIAL NATIONAL HISTORIES ARE LIKE PAPER MONEY THEY CAN BE USED ANDCAN CIRCULATE AND FULFILL THEIR PURPOSE WITHOUT HARM TO ANYONE AND EVENADVANTAGEOUSLY AS LONG AS NO ONE ASKS WHAT IS THE SECURITY BEHIND THEMYOU NEED ONLY FORGET TO ASK HOW THE WILL OF HEROES PRODUCES EVENTS ANDSUCH HISTORIES AS THIERS WILL BE INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE AND MAYPERHAPS EVEN POSSESS A TINGE OF POETRY BUT JUST AS DOUBTS OF THE REALVALUE OF PAPER MONEY ARISE EITHER BECAUSE BEING EASY TO MAKE TOO MUCHOF IT GETS MADE OR BECAUSE PEOPLE TRY TO EXCHANGE IT FOR GOLD SO ALSODOUBTS CONCERNING THE REAL VALUE OF SUCH HISTORIES ARISE EITHER BECAUSETOO MANY OF THEM ARE WRITTEN OR BECAUSE IN HIS SIMPLICITY OF HEARTSOMEONE INQUIRES BY WHAT FORCE DID NAPOLEON DO THISTHAT IS WANTSTO EXCHANGE THE CURRENT PAPER MONEY FOR THE REAL GOLD OF ACTUALCOMPREHENSIONTHE WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORIES AND OF

MERELY FOR EXCHANGE BUT ALSO FOR USESO UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WILL BE VALUABLE ONLY WHEN THEY CAN REPLY TOHISTORYS ESSENTIAL QUESTION WHAT IS POWER THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANSGIVE CONTRADICTORY REPLIES TO THAT QUESTION WHILE THE HISTORIANS OFCULTURE EVADE IT AND ANSWER SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND AS COUNTERSOF IMITATION GOLD CAN BE USED ONLY AMONG A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO AGREE TOACCEPT THEM AS GOLD OR AMONG THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THE NATURE OFGOLD SO UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF CULTURE NOT ANSWERINGHUMANITYS ESSENTIAL QUESTION SERVE AS CURRENCY FOR SOME PURPOSES OFTHEIR OWN ONLY IN UNIVERSITIES AND AMONG THE MASS OF READERS WHO HAVE ATASTE FOR WHAT THEY CALL SERIOUS READINGCHAPTER IVHAVING ABANDONED THE CONCEPTION OF THE ANCIENTS AS TO THE DIVINESUBJECTION OF THE WILL OF A NATION TO SOME CHOSEN MAN AND THE SUBJECTIONOF THAT MANS WILL TO THE DEITY HISTORY CANNOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTIONSTAKE A SINGLE STEP TILL IT HAS CHOSEN ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER A RETURNTO THE FORMER BELIEF IN THE DIRECT INTERVENTION OF THE DEITY IN HUMANAFFAIRS OR A DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF THE MEANING OF THE FORCE PRODUCINGHISTORICAL EVENTS AND TERMED POWERA RETURN TO THE FIRST IS IMPOSSIBLE THE BELIEF HAS BEEN DESTROYED ANDSO IT IS ESSENTIAL TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS MEANT BY POWERNAPOLEON ORDERED AN ARMY TO BE RAISED AND GO TO WAR WE ARE SOACCUSTOMED TO THAT IDEA AND HAVE BECOME SO USED TO IT THAT THE QUESTIONWHY DID SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN GO TO FIGHT WHEN NAPOLEON UTTEREDCERTAIN WORDS SEEMS TO US SENSELESS HE HAD THE POWER AND SO WHAT HEORDERED WAS DONETHIS REPLY IS QUITE SATISFACTORY IF WE BELIEVE THAT THE POWER WAS GIVENHIM BY GOD BUT AS SOON AS WE DO NOT ADMIT THAT IT BECOMES ESSENTIAL TODETERMINE WHAT IS THIS POWER OF ONE MAN OVER OTHERSIT CANNOT BE THE DIRECT PHYSICAL POWER OF A STRONG MAN OVER A WEAK ONEADOMINATION BASED ON THE APPLICATION OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL FORCE LIKETHE POWER OF HERCULES NOR CAN IT BE BASED ON THE EFFECT OF MORAL FORCEAS IN THEIR SIMPLICITY SOME HISTORIANS THINK WHO SAY THAT THE LEADINGFIGURES IN HISTORY ARE HEROES THAT IS MEN GIFTED WITH A SPECIALSTRENGTH OF SOUL AND MIND CALLED GENIUS THIS POWER CANNOT BE BASED ONTHE PREDOMINANCE OF MORAL STRENGTH FOR NOT TO MENTION HEROES SUCH ASNAPOLEON ABOUT WHOSE MORAL QUALITIES OPINIONS DIFFER WIDELY HISTORYSHOWS US THAT NEITHER A LOUIS XI NOR A METTERNICH WHO RULED OVERMILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAD ANY PARTICULAR MORAL QUALITIES BUT ON THECONTRARY WERE GENERALLY MORALLY WEAKER THAN ANY OF THE MILLIONS THEYRULED OVERIF THE SOURCE OF POWER LIES NEITHER IN THE PHYSICAL NOR IN THE MORALQUALITIES OF HIM WHO POSSESSES IT IT MUST EVIDENTLY BE LOOKED FORELSEWHEREIN THE RELATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE MAN WHO WIELDS THE POWERAND THAT IS HOW POWER IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCETHAT EXCHANGE BANK OF HISTORY WHICH OFFERS TO EXCHANGE HISTORYSUNDERSTANDING OF POWER FOR TRUE GOLDPOWER IS THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED BY EXPRESSED ORTACIT CONSENT TO THEIR CHOSEN RULERSIN THE DOMAIN OF JURISPRUDENCE WHICH CONSISTS OF DISCUSSIONS OF HOW ASTATE AND POWER MIGHT BE ARRANGED WERE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL THAT TOBE ARRANGED IT IS ALL VERY CLEAR BUT WHEN APPLIED TO HISTORY THATDEFINITION OF POWER NEEDS EXPLANATIONTHE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE REGARDS THE STATE AND POWER AS THE ANCIENTSREGARDED FIRENAMELY AS SOMETHING EXISTING ABSOLUTELY BUT FOR HISTORYTHE STATE AND POWER ARE MERELY PHENOMENA JUST AS FOR MODERN PHYSICSFIRE IS NOT AN ELEMENT BUT A PHENOMENONFROM THIS FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VIEW HELD BY HISTORY ANDTHAT HELD BY JURISPRUDENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT JURISPRUDENCE CAN TELLMINUTELY HOW IN ITS OPINION POWER SHOULD BE CONSTITUTED AND WHATPOWEREXISTING IMMUTABLY OUTSIDE TIMEIS BUT TO HISTORYS QUESTIONSABOUT THE MEANING OF THE MUTATIONS OF POWER IN TIME IT CAN ANSWERNOTHINGIF POWER BE THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED TO THEIRRULER WAS PUGACHV A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IF NOTTHEN WHY WAS NAPOLEON I WHY WAS NAPOLEON III A CRIMINAL WHEN HE WASTAKEN PRISONER AT BOULOGNE AND WHY LATER ON WERE THOSE CRIMINALS WHOMHE ARRESTEDDO PALACE REVOLUTIONSIN WHICH SOMETIMES ONLY TWO OR THREE PEOPLE TAKEPARTTRANSFER THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO A NEW RULER IN INTERNATIONALRELATIONS IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ALSO TRANSFERRED TO THEIRCONQUEROR WAS THE WILL OF THE CONFEDERATION OF THE RHINE TRANSFERREDTO NAPOLEON IN  WAS THE WILL OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE TRANSFERREDTO NAPOLEON IN  WHEN OUR ARMY IN ALLIANCE WITH THE FRENCH WENT TOFIGHT THE AUSTRIANSTO THESE QUESTIONS THREE ANSWERS ARE POSSIBLEEITHER TO ASSUME  THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS ALWAYSUNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE RULER OR RULERS THEY HAVE CHOSEN ANDTHAT THEREFORE EVERY EMERGENCE OF A NEW POWER EVERY STRUGGLEAGAINST THE POWER ONCE APPOINTED SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY REGARDED AS ANINFRINGEMENT OF THE REAL POWER OR  THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLEIS TRANSFERRED TO THE RULERS CONDITIONALLY UNDER DEFINITE AND KNOWNCONDITIONS AND TO SHOW THAT ALL LIMITATIONS CONFLICTS AND EVENDESTRUCTIONS OF POWER RESULT FROM A NONOBSERVANCE BY THE RULERS OF THECONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEIR POWER WAS ENTRUSTED TO THEM OR  THATTHE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS DELEGATED TO THE RULERS CONDITIONALLY BUTTHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN AND INDEFINITE AND THAT THE APPEARANCEOF SEVERAL AUTHORITIES THEIR STRUGGLES AND THEIR FALLS RESULT SOLELYFROM THE GREATER OR LESSER FULFILLMENT BY THE RULERS OF THESE UNKNOWNCONDITIONS ON WHICH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS TRANSFERRED FROM SOMEPEOPLE TO OTHERSAND THESE ARE THE THREE WAYS IN WHICH THE HISTORIANS DO EXPLAIN THERELATION OF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR RULERSSOME HISTORIANSTHOSE BIOGRAPHICAL AND SPECIALIST HISTORIANS ALREADYREFERRED TOIN THEIR SIMPLICITY FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION OFTHE MEANING OF POWER SEEM TO CONSIDER THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OFTHE PEOPLE IS UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED TO HISTORICAL PERSONS ANDTHEREFORE WHEN DESCRIBING SOME SINGLE STATE THEY ASSUME THAT PARTICULARPOWER TO BE THE ONE ABSOLUTE AND REAL POWER AND THAT ANY OTHER FORCEOPPOSING THIS IS NOT A POWER BUT A VIOLATION OF POWERMERE VIOLENCETHEIR THEORY SUITABLE FOR PRIMITIVE AND PEACEFUL PERIODS OF HISTORYHAS THE INCONVENIENCEIN APPLICATION TO COMPLEX AND STORMY PERIODS INTHE LIFE OF NATIONS DURING WHICH VARIOUS POWERS ARISE SIMULTANEOUSLY ANDSTRUGGLE WITH ONE ANOTHERTHAT A LEGITIMIST HISTORIAN WILL PROVETHAT THE NATIONAL CONVENTION THE DIRECTORY AND BONAPARTE WERE MEREINFRINGERS OF THE TRUE POWER WHILE A REPUBLICAN AND A BONAPARTIST WILLPROVE THE ONE THAT THE CONVENTION AND THE OTHER THAT THE EMPIRE WAS THEREAL POWER AND THAT ALL THE OTHERS WERE VIOLATIONS OF POWEREVIDENTLY THE EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY THESE HISTORIANS BEING MUTUALLYCONTRADICTORY CAN ONLY SATISFY YOUNG CHILDRENRECOGNIZING THE FALSITY OF THIS VIEW OF HISTORY ANOTHER SET OFHISTORIANS SAY THAT POWER RESTS ON A CONDITIONAL DELEGATION OF THE WILLOF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR RULERS AND THAT HISTORICAL LEADERS HAVE POWERONLY CONDITIONALLY ON CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM THAT THE WILL OF THEPEOPLE HAS BY TACIT AGREEMENT PRESCRIBED TO THEM BUT WHAT THIS PROGRAMCONSISTS IN THESE HISTORIANS DO NOT SAY OR IF THEY DO THEY CONTINUALLYCONTRADICT ONE ANOTHEREACH HISTORIAN ACCORDING TO HIS VIEW OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A NATIONSPROGRESS LOOKS FOR THESE CONDITIONS IN THE GREATNESS WEALTH FREEDOMOR ENLIGHTENMENT OF CITIZENS OF FRANCE OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY BUT NOTTO MENTION THE HISTORIANS CONTRADICTIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THISPROGRAMOR EVEN ADMITTING THAT SOME ONE GENERAL PROGRAM OF THESECONDITIONS EXISTSTHE FACTS OF HISTORY ALMOST ALWAYS CONTRADICT THATTHEORY IF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH POWER IS ENTRUSTED CONSIST IN THEWEALTH FREEDOM AND ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE PEOPLE HOW IS IT THAT LOUISXIV AND IVN THE TERRIBLE END THEIR REIGNS TRANQUILLY WHILE LOUIS XVIAND CHARLES I ARE EXECUTED BY THEIR PEOPLE TO THIS QUESTION HISTORIANSREPLY THAT LOUIS XIVS ACTIVITY CONTRARY TO THE PROGRAM REACTED ONLOUIS XVI BUT WHY DID IT NOT REACT ON LOUIS XIV OR ON LOUIS XVWHYSHOULD IT REACT JUST ON LOUIS XVI AND WHAT IS THE TIME LIMIT FOR SUCHREACTIONS TO THESE QUESTIONS THERE ARE AND CAN BE NO ANSWERS EQUALLYLITTLE DOES THIS VIEW EXPLAIN WHY FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES THE COLLECTIVEWILL IS NOT WITHDRAWN FROM CERTAIN RULERS AND THEIR HEIRS ANDTHEN SUDDENLY DURING A PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS IS TRANSFERRED TO THECONVENTION TO THE DIRECTORY TO NAPOLEON TO ALEXANDER TO LOUIS XVIIITO NAPOLEON AGAIN TO CHARLES X TO LOUIS PHILIPPE TO A REPUBLICANGOVERNMENT AND TO NAPOLEON III WHEN EXPLAINING THESE RAPID TRANSFERSOF THE PEOPLES WILL FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER ESPECIALLY IN VIEWOF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CONQUESTS AND ALLIANCES THE HISTORIANS AREOBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT SOME OF THESE TRANSFERS ARE NOT NORMAL DELEGATIONSOF THE PEOPLES WILL BUT ARE ACCIDENTS DEPENDENT ON CUNNING ONMISTAKES ON CRAFT OR ON THE WEAKNESS OF A DIPLOMATIST A RULER OR APARTY LEADER SO THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE EVENTS OF HISTORYCIVILWARS REVOLUTIONS AND CONQUESTSARE PRESENTED BY THESE HISTORIANSNOT AS THE RESULTS OF FREE TRANSFERENCES OF THE PEOPLES WILL BUT ASRESULTS OF THE ILLDIRECTED WILL OF ONE OR MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT ISONCE AGAIN AS USURPATIONS OF POWER AND SO THESE HISTORIANS ALSO SEEAND ADMIT HISTORICAL EVENTS WHICH ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE THEORYTHESE HISTORIANS RESEMBLE A BOTANIST WHO HAVING NOTICED THAT SOMEPLANTS GROW FROM SEEDS PRODUCING TWO COTYLEDONS SHOULD INSIST THAT ALLTHAT GROWS DOES SO BY SPROUTING INTO TWO LEAVES AND THAT THE PALM THEMUSHROOM AND EVEN THE OAK WHICH BLOSSOM INTO FULL GROWTH AND NO LONGERRESEMBLE TWO LEAVES ARE DEVIATIONS FROM THE THEORYHISTORIANS OF THE THIRD CLASS ASSUME THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLEIS TRANSFERRED TO HISTORIC PERSONAGES CONDITIONALLY BUT THAT THECONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN TO US THEY SAY THAT HISTORICAL PERSONAGES HAVEPOWER ONLY BECAUSE THEY FULFILL THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WHICH HAS BEENDELEGATED TO THEMBUT IN THAT CASE IF THE FORCE THAT MOVES NATIONS LIES NOT IN THEHISTORIC LEADERS BUT IN THE NATIONS THEMSELVES WHAT SIGNIFICANCE HAVETHOSE LEADERSTHE LEADERS THESE HISTORIANS TELL US EXPRESS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLETHE ACTIVITY OF THE LEADERS REPRESENTS THE ACTIVITY OF THE PEOPLEBUT IN THAT CASE THE QUESTION ARISES WHETHER ALL THE ACTIVITY OF THELEADERS SERVES AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PEOPLES WILL OR ONLY SOME PARTOF IT IF THE WHOLE ACTIVITY OF THE LEADERS SERVES AS THE EXPRESSION OFTHE PEOPLES WILL AS SOME HISTORIANS SUPPOSE THEN ALL THE DETAILSOF THE COURT SCANDALS CONTAINED IN THE BIOGRAPHIES OF A NAPOLEON ORA CATHERINE SERVE TO EXPRESS THE LIFE OF THE NATION WHICH IS EVIDENTNONSENSE BUT IF IT IS ONLY SOME PARTICULAR SIDE OF THE ACTIVITY OF ANHISTORICAL LEADER WHICH SERVES TO EXPRESS THE PEOPLES LIFE AS OTHERSOCALLED PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORIANS BELIEVE THEN TO DETERMINE WHICHSIDE OF THE ACTIVITY OF A LEADER EXPRESSES THE NATIONS LIFE WE HAVEFIRST OF ALL TO KNOW IN WHAT THE NATIONS LIFE CONSISTSMET BY THIS DIFFICULTY HISTORIANS OF THAT CLASS DEVISE SOME MOSTOBSCURE IMPALPABLE AND GENERAL ABSTRACTION WHICH CAN COVER ALLCONCEIVABLE OCCURRENCES AND DECLARE THIS ABSTRACTION TO BE THE AIM OFHUMANITYS MOVEMENT THE MOST USUAL GENERALIZATIONS ADOPTED BY ALMOSTALL THE HISTORIANS ARE FREEDOM EQUALITY ENLIGHTENMENT PROGRESSCIVILIZATION AND CULTURE POSTULATING SOME GENERALIZATION AS THE GOALOF THE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY THE HISTORIANS STUDY THE MEN OF WHOM THEGREATEST NUMBER OF MONUMENTS HAVE REMAINED KINGS MINISTERS GENERALSAUTHORS REFORMERS POPES AND JOURNALISTS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH INTHEIR OPINION THESE PERSONS HAVE PROMOTED OR HINDERED THAT ABSTRACTIONBUT AS IT IS IN NO WAY PROVED THAT THE AIM OF HUMANITY DOES CONSIST INFREEDOM EQUALITY ENLIGHTENMENT OR CIVILIZATION AND AS THE CONNECTIONOF THE PEOPLE WITH THE RULERS AND ENLIGHTENERS OF HUMANITY IS ONLY BASEDON THE ARBITRARY ASSUMPTION THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ISALWAYS TRANSFERRED TO THE MEN WHOM WE HAVE NOTICED IT HAPPENS THAT THEACTIVITY OF THE MILLIONS WHO MIGRATE BURN HOUSES ABANDON AGRICULTUREAND DESTROY ONE ANOTHER NEVER IS EXPRESSED IN THE ACCOUNT OF THEACTIVITY OF SOME DOZEN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT BURN HOUSES PRACTICEAGRICULTURE OR SLAY THEIR FELLOW CREATURESHISTORY PROVES THIS AT EVERY TURN IS

THE PEOPLESCHAPTER VTHE LIFE OF THE NATIONS IS NOT CONTAINED IN THE LIVES OF A FEW MEN FORTHE CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE MEN AND THE NATIONS HAS NOT BEEN FOUNDTHE THEORY THAT THIS CONNECTION IS BASED ON THE TRANSFERENCE OF THECOLLECTIVE WILL OF A PEOPLE TO CERTAIN HISTORICAL PERSONAGES IS ANHYPOTHESIS UNCONFIRMED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF HISTORYTHE THEORY OF THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TOHISTORIC PERSONS MAY PERHAPS EXPLAIN MUCH IN THE DOMAIN OF JURISPRUDENCEAND BE ESSENTIAL FOR ITS PURPOSES BUT IN ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY ASSOON AS REVOLUTIONS CONQUESTS OR CIVIL WARS OCCURTHAT IS AS SOON ASHISTORY BEGINSTHAT THEORY EXPLAINS NOTHINGTHE THEORY SEEMS IRREFUTABLE JUST BECAUSE THE ACT OF TRANSFERENCE OF THEPEOPLES WILL CANNOT BE VERIFIED FOR IT NEVER OCCURREDWHATEVER HAPPENS AND WHOEVER MAY STAND AT THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS THETHEORY CAN ALWAYS SAY THAT SUCH AND SUCH A PERSON TOOK THE LEAD BECAUSETHE COLLECTIVE WILL WAS TRANSFERRED TO HIMTHE REPLIES THIS THEORY GIVES TO HISTORICAL QUESTIONS ARE LIKE THEREPLIES OF A MAN WHO WATCHING THE MOVEMENTS OF A HERD OF CATTLE ANDPAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE VARYING QUALITY OF THE PASTURAGE IN DIFFERENTPARTS OF THE FIELD OR TO THE DRIVING OF THE HERDSMAN SHOULD ATTRIBUTETHE DIRECTION THE HERD TAKES TO WHAT ANIMAL HAPPENS TO BE AT ITS HEADTHE HERD GOES IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE THE ANIMAL IN FRONT LEADSIT AND THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS IS VESTED IN THATLEADER THIS IS WHAT HISTORIANS OF THE FIRST CLASS SAYTHOSE WHO ASSUMETHE UNCONDITIONAL TRANSFERENCE OF THE PEOPLES WILLIF THE ANIMALS LEADING THE HERD CHANGE THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THECOLLECTIVE WILL OF ALL THE ANIMALS IS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE LEADER TOANOTHER ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE ANIMAL IS OR IS NOT LEADING THEM INTHE DIRECTION SELECTED BY THE WHOLE HERD SUCH IS THE REPLY HISTORIANSWHO ASSUME THAT THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS DELEGATED TORULERS UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH THEY REGARD AS KNOWN WITH THIS METHODOF OBSERVATION IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT THE OBSERVER INFLUENCED BY THEDIRECTION HE HIMSELF PREFERS REGARDS THOSE AS LEADERS WHO OWING TO THEPEOPLES CHANGE OF DIRECTION ARE NO LONGER IN FRONT BUT ON ONE SIDEOR EVEN IN THE REARIF THE ANIMALS IN FRONT ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING AND THE DIRECTION OFTHE WHOLE HERD IS CONSTANTLY ALTERED THIS IS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FOLLOWA GIVEN DIRECTION THE ANIMALS TRANSFER THEIR WILL TO THE ANIMALS THATHAVE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION AND TO STUDY THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HERDWE MUST WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL THE PROMINENT ANIMALS MOVING ON ALLSIDES OF THE HERD SO SAY THE THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS WHO REGARD ALLHISTORICAL PERSONS FROM MONARCHS TO JOURNALISTS AS THE EXPRESSION OFTHEIR AGETHE THEORY OF THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO HISTORICPERSONS IS MERELY A PARAPHRASEA RESTATEMENT OF THE QUESTION IN OTHERWORDSWHAT CAUSES HISTORICAL EVENTS POWER WHAT IS POWER POWER IS THECOLLECTIVE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TRANSFERRED TO ONE PERSON UNDER WHATCONDITION IS THE

EXPERIENCE SHOWS US THAT WHATEVER EVENT OCCURS IT IS ALWAYSRELATED TO THE WILL OF ONE OR OF SEVERAL MEN WHO HAVE DECREED ITTHE HISTORIANS IN ACCORD WITH THE OLD HABIT OF ACKNOWLEDGING DIVINEINTERVENTION IN HUMAN AFFAIRS WANT TO SEE THE CAUSE OF EVENTS INTHE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF SOMEONE ENDOWED WITH POWER BUT THATSUPPOSITION IS NOT CONFIRMED EITHER BY REASON OR BY EXPERIENCEON THE ONE SIDE REFLECTION SHOWS THAT THE EXPRESSION OF A MANS WILLHISWORDSARE ONLY PART OF THE GENERAL ACTIVITY EXPRESSED IN AN EVENTAS FOR INSTANCE IN A WAR OR A REVOLUTION AND SO WITHOUT ASSUMING ANINCOMPREHENSIBLE SUPERNATURAL FORCEA MIRACLEONE CANNOT ADMIT THATWORDS CAN BE THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF MILLIONS OF MENON THE OTHER HAND EVEN IF WE ADMITTED THAT WORDS COULD BE THE CAUSEOF EVENTS HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF HISTORICALPERSONAGES DOES NOT IN MOST CASES PRODUCE ANY EFFECT THAT IS TO SAYTHEIR COMMANDS ARE OFTEN NOT EXECUTED AND SOMETIMES THE VERY OPPOSITEOF WHAT THEY ORDER OCCURSWITHOUT ADMITTING DIVINE INTERVENTION IN THE AFFAIRS OF HUMANITY WECANNOT REGARD POWER AS THE CAUSE OF EVENTSPOWER FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EXPERIENCE IS MERELY THE RELATION THATEXISTS BETWEEN THE EXPRESSION OF SOMEONES WILL AND THE EXECUTION OFTHAT WILL BY OTHERSTO EXPLAIN THE CONDITIONS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP WE MUST FIRST ESTABLISH ACONCEPTION OF THE EXPRESSION OF WILL REFERRING IT TO MAN AND NOT TO THEDEITYIF THE DEITY ISSUES A COMMAND EXPRESSES HIS WILL AS ANCIENT HISTORYTELLS US THE EXPRESSION OF THAT WILL IS INDEPENDENT OF TIME AND IS NOTCAUSED BY ANYTHING FOR THE DIVINITY IS NOT CONTROLLED BY AN EVENT BUTSPEAKING OF COMMANDS THAT ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF MEN ACTINGIN TIME AND IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION OFCOMMANDS WITH EVENTS WE MUST RESTORE  THE CONDITION OF ALL THATTAKES PLACE THE CONTINUITY OF MOVEMENT IN TIME BOTH OF THE EVENTS ANDOF THE PERSON WHO COMMANDS AND  THE INEVITABILITY OF THE CONNECTIONBETWEEN THE PERSON COMMANDING AND THOSE WHO EXECUTE HIS COMMANDCHAPTER VIONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE DEITY NOT DEPENDENT ON TIME CANRELATE TO A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS OCCURRING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS ORCENTURIES AND ONLY THE DEITY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYTHING CAN BY HISSOLE WILL DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF HUMANITYS MOVEMENT BUT MAN ACTSIN TIME AND HIMSELF TAKES PART IN WHAT OCCURSREINSTATING THE FIRST CONDITION OMITTED THAT OF TIME WE SEE THAT NOCOMMAND CAN BE EXECUTED WITHOUT SOME PRECEDING ORDER HAVING BEEN GIVENRENDERING THE EXECUTION OF THE LAST COMMAND POSSIBLENO COMMAND EVER APPEARS SPONTANEOUSLY OR ITSELF COVERS A WHOLE SERIESOF OCCURRENCES BUT EACH COMMAND FOLLOWS FROM ANOTHER AND NEVER REFERSTO A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS BUT ALWAYS TO ONE MOMENT ONLY OF AN EVENTWHEN FOR INSTANCE WE SAY THAT NAPOLEON ORDERED ARMIES TO GO TO WARWE COMBINE IN ONE SIMULTANEOUS EXPRESSION A WHOLE SERIES OF CONSECUTIVECOMMANDS DEPENDENT ONE ON ANOTHER NAPOLEON COULD NOT HAVE COMMANDEDAN INVASION OF RUSSIA AND NEVER DID SO TODAY HE ORDERED SUCH AND SUCHPAPERS TO BE WRITTEN TO VIENNA TO BERLIN AND TO PETERSBURGTOMORROW SUCH AND SUCH DECREES AND ORDERS TO THE ARMY THE FLEET THECOMMISSARIAT AND SO ON AND SO ONMILLIONS OF COMMANDS WHICH FORMEDA WHOLE SERIES CORRESPONDING TO A SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH BROUGHT THEFRENCH ARMIES INTO RUSSIAIF THROUGHOUT HIS REIGN NAPOLEON GAVE COMMANDS CONCERNING AN INVASIONOF ENGLAND AND EXPENDED ON NO OTHER UNDERTAKING SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORTAND YET DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN NEVER ONCE ATTEMPTED TO EXECUTE THATDESIGN BUT UNDERTOOK AN EXPEDITION INTO RUSSIA WITH WHICH COUNTRY HECONSIDERED IT DESIRABLE TO BE IN ALLIANCE A CONVICTION HE REPEATEDLYEXPRESSEDTHIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE HIS COMMANDS DID NOT CORRESPOND TOTHE COURSE OF EVENTS IN THE FIRST CASE BUT DID SO CORRESPOND IN THELATTERFOR AN ORDER TO BE CERTAINLY EXECUTED IT IS NECESSARY THAT A MAN SHOULDORDER WHAT CAN BE EXECUTED BUT TO KNOW WHAT CAN AND WHAT CANNOT BEEXECUTED IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONLY IN THE CASE OF NAPOLEONS INVASION OFRUSSIA IN WHICH MILLIONS PARTICIPATED BUT EVEN IN THE SIMPLEST EVENTFOR IN EITHER CASE MILLIONS OF OBSTACLES MAY ARISE TO PREVENT ITSEXECUTION EVERY ORDER EXECUTED IS ALWAYS ONE OF AN IMMENSE NUMBERUNEXECUTED ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE ORDERS INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURSE OFEVENTS REMAIN UNEXECUTED ONLY THE POSSIBLE ONES GET LINKED UP WITH ACONSECUTIVE SERIES OF COMMANDS CORRESPONDING TO A SERIES OF EVENTS ANDARE EXECUTEDOUR FALSE CONCEPTION THAT AN EVENT IS CAUSED BY A COMMAND WHICH PRECEDESIT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THE EVENT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND OUT OFTHOUSANDS OF OTHERS THOSE FEW COMMANDS WHICH WERE CONSISTENT WITH THATEVENT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED WE FORGET ABOUT THE OTHERS THAT WERE NOTEXECUTED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BE APART FROM THAT THE CHIEF SOURCEOF OUR ERROR IN THIS MATTER IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN THE HISTORICALACCOUNTS A WHOLE SERIES OF INNUMERABLE DIVERSE AND PETTY EVENTS SUCHFOR INSTANCE AS ALL THOSE WHICH LED THE FRENCH ARMIES TO RUSSIA ISGENERALIZED INTO ONE EVENT IN ACCORD WITH THE RESULT PRODUCED BY THATSERIES OF EVENTS AND CORRESPONDING WITH THIS GENERALIZATION THE WHOLESERIES OF COMMANDS IS ALSO GENERALIZED INTO A SINGLE EXPRESSION OF WILLWE SAY THAT NAPOLEON WISHED TO INVADE RUSSIA AND INVADED IT INREALITY IN ALL NAPOLEONS ACTIVITY WE NEVER FIND ANYTHING RESEMBLING ANEXPRESSION OF THAT WISH BUT FIND A SERIES OF ORDERS OR EXPRESSIONS OFHIS WILL VERY VARIOUSLY AND INDEFINITELY DIRECTED AMID A LONG SERIESOF UNEXECUTED ORDERS OF NAPOLEONS ONE SERIES FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF WAS CARRIED OUTNOT BECAUSE THOSE ORDERS DIFFERED IN ANY WAY FROM THEOTHER UNEXECUTED ORDERS BUT BECAUSE THEY COINCIDED WITH THE COURSE OFEVENTS THAT LED THE FRENCH ARMY INTO RUSSIA JUST AS IN STENCIL WORKTHIS OR THAT FIGURE COMES OUT NOT BECAUSE THE COLOR WAS LAID ON FROMTHIS SIDE OR IN THAT WAY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS LAID ON FROM ALL SIDES OVERTHE FIGURE CUT IN THE STENCILSO THAT EXAMINING THE RELATION IN TIME OF THE COMMANDS TO THE EVENTSWE FIND THAT A COMMAND CAN NEVER BE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT BUT THAT ACERTAIN DEFINITE DEPENDENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWOTO UNDERSTAND IN WHAT THIS DEPENDENCE CONSISTS IT IS NECESSARY TOREINSTATE ANOTHER OMITTED CONDITION OF EVERY COMMAND PROCEEDING NOT FROMTHE DEITY BUT FROM A MAN WHICH IS THAT THE MAN WHO GIVES THE COMMANDHIMSELF TAKES PART IN THE EVENTTHIS RELATION OF THE COMMANDER TO THOSE HE COMMANDS IS JUST WHAT ISCALLED POWER THIS RELATION CONSISTS IN THE FOLLOWINGFOR COMMON ACTION PEOPLE ALWAYS UNITE IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS IN WHICHREGARDLESS OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE AIMS SET FOR THE COMMON ACTION THERELATION BETWEEN THOSE TAKING PART IN IT IS ALWAYS THE SAMEMEN UNITING IN THESE COMBINATIONS ALWAYS ASSUME SUCH RELATIONS TOWARDONE ANOTHER THAT THE LARGER

NEXTHIGHER GRADES OF THE ARMY AND SO ON TO THE APEX THE POINT OF WHICHWILL REPRESENT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEFTHE SOLDIERS OF WHOM THERE ARE THE MOST FORM THE LOWER SECTION OFTHE CONE AND ITS BASE THE SOLDIER HIMSELF DOES THE STABBING HACKINGBURNING AND PILLAGING AND ALWAYS RECEIVES ORDERS FOR THESE ACTIONSFROM MEN ABOVE HIM HE HIMSELF NEVER GIVES AN ORDER THE NONCOMMISSIONEDOFFICERS OF WHOM THERE ARE FEWER PERFORM THE ACTION ITSELF LESSFREQUENTLY THAN THE SOLDIERS BUT THEY ALREADY GIVE COMMANDS ANOFFICER STILL LESS OFTEN ACTS DIRECTLY HIMSELF BUT COMMANDS STILL MOREFREQUENTLY A GENERAL DOES NOTHING BUT COMMAND THE TROOPS INDICATES THEOBJECTIVE AND HARDLY EVER USES A WEAPON HIMSELF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEFNEVER TAKES DIRECT PART IN THE ACTION ITSELF BUT ONLY GIVES GENERALORDERS CONCERNING THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASS OF THE TROOPS A SIMILARRELATION OF PEOPLE TO ONE ANOTHER IS SEEN IN EVERY COMBINATION OF MENFOR COMMON ACTIVITYIN AGRICULTURE TRADE AND EVERY ADMINISTRATIONAND SO WITHOUT PARTICULARLY ANALYZING ALL THE CONTIGUOUS SECTIONS OFA CONE AND OF THE RANKS OF AN ARMY OR THE RANKS AND POSITIONS INANY ADMINISTRATIVE OR PUBLIC BUSINESS WHATEVER FROM THE LOWEST TO THEHIGHEST WE SEE A LAW BY WHICH MEN TO TAKE ASSOCIATED ACTION COMBINEIN SUCH RELATIONS THAT THE MORE DIRECTLY THEY PARTICIPATE IN PERFORMINGTHE ACTION THE LESS THEY CAN COMMAND AND THE MORE NUMEROUS THEY AREWHILE THE LESS THEIR DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN THE ACTION ITSELF THE MORETHEY COMMAND AND THE FEWER OF THEM THERE ARE RISING IN THIS WAY FROMTHE LOWEST RANKS TO THE MAN AT THE TOP WHO TAKES THE LEAST DIRECT SHAREIN THE ACTION AND DIRECTS HIS ACTIVITY CHIEFLY TO COMMANDINGTHIS RELATION OF THE MEN WHO COMMAND TO THOSE THEY COMMAND IS WHATCONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THE CONCEPTION CALLED POWERHAVING RESTORED THE CONDITION OF TIME UNDER WHICH ALL EVENTS OCCURWE FIND THAT A COMMAND IS EXECUTED ONLY WHEN IT IS RELATED TO ACORRESPONDING SERIES OF EVENTS RESTORING THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION OFRELATION BETWEEN THOSE WHO COMMAND AND THOSE WHO EXECUTE WE FIND THATBY THE VERY NATURE OF THE CASE THOSE WHO COMMAND TAKE THE SMALLEST PARTIN THE ACTION ITSELF AND THAT THEIR ACTIVITY IS EXCLUSIVELY DIRECTED TOCOMMANDINGCHAPTER VIIWHEN AN EVENT IS TAKING PLACE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS AND WISHESABOUT IT AND AS THE EVENT RESULTS FROM THE COLLECTIVE ACTIVITY OFMANY PEOPLE SOME ONE OF THE OPINIONS OR WISHES EXPRESSED IS SURE TO BEFULFILLED IF BUT APPROXIMATELY WHEN ONE OF THE OPINIONS EXPRESSEDIS FULFILLED THAT OPINION GETS CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT AS A COMMANDPRECEDING ITMEN ARE HAULING A LOG EACH OF THEM EXPRESSES HIS OPINION AS TO HOW ANDWHERE TO HAUL IT THEY HAUL THE LOG AWAY AND IT HAPPENS THAT THIS ISDONE AS ONE OF THEM SAID HE ORDERED IT THERE WE HAVE COMMAND AND POWERIN THEIR PRIMARY FORM THE MAN WHO WORKED MOST WITH HIS HANDS COULD NOTTHINK SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING OR REFLECT ON OR COMMAND WHATWOULD RESULT FROM THE COMMON ACTIVITY WHILE THE MAN WHO COMMANDEDMORE WOULD EVIDENTLY WORK LESS WITH HIS HANDS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GREATERVERBAL ACTIVITYWHEN SOME LARGER CONCOURSE OF MEN DIRECT THEIR ACTIVITY TO A COMMON AIMTHERE IS A YET SHARPER DIVISION OF THOSE WHO BECAUSE THEIR ACTIVITY ISGIVEN TO DIRECTING AND COMMANDING TAKE LESS PART IN THE DIRECT WORKWHEN A MAN WORKS ALONE HE ALWAYS HAS A CERTAIN SET OF REFLECTIONS WHICHAS IT SEEMS TO HIM DIRECTED HIS PAST ACTIVITY JUSTIFY HIS PRESENTACTIVITY AND GUIDE HIM IN PLANNING HIS FUTURE ACTIONS JUST THE SAME ISDONE BY A CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE ALLOWING THOSE WHO DO NOT TAKE A DIRECTPART IN THE ACTIVITY TO DEVISE CONSIDERATIONS JUSTIFICATIONS ANDSURMISES CONCERNING THEIR COLLECTIVE ACTIVITYFOR REASONS KNOWN OR UNKNOWN TO US THE FRENCH BEGAN TO DROWN AND KILLONE ANOTHER AND CORRESPONDING TO THE EVENT ITS JUSTIFICATION APPEARS INPEOPLES BELIEF THAT THIS WAS NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF FRANCE FORLIBERTY AND FOR EQUALITY PEOPLE CEASED TO KILL ONE ANOTHER ANDTHIS EVENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ITS JUSTIFICATION IN THE NECESSITY FOR ACENTRALIZATION OF POWER RESISTANCE TO EUROPE AND SO ON MEN WENTFROM THE WEST TO THE EAST KILLING THEIR FELLOW MEN AND THE EVENTWAS ACCOMPANIED BY PHRASES ABOUT THE GLORY OF FRANCE THE BASENESS OFENGLAND AND SO ON HISTORY SHOWS US THAT THESE JUSTIFICATIONS OF THEEVENTS HAVE NO COMMON SENSE AND ARE ALL CONTRADICTORY AS IN THE CASE OFKILLING A MAN AS THE RESULT OF RECOGNIZING HIS RIGHTS AND THE KILLINGOF MILLIONS IN RUSSIA FOR THE HUMILIATION OF ENGLAND BUT THESEJUSTIFICATIONS HAVE A VERY NECESSARY SIGNIFICANCE IN THEIR OWN DAYTHESE JUSTIFICATIONS RELEASE THOSE WHO PRODUCE THE EVENTS FROM MORALRESPONSIBILITY THESE TEMPORARY AIMS ARE LIKE THE BROOM FIXED IN FRONTOF A LOCOMOTIVE TO CLEAR THE SNOW FROM THE RAILS IN FRONT THEY CLEARMENS MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THEIR PATHWITHOUT SUCH JUSTIFICATION THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY TO THE SIMPLESTQUESTION THAT PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN EXAMINING EACH HISTORICAL EVENT HOWIS IT THAT MILLIONS OF MEN COMMIT COLLECTIVE CRIMESMAKE WAR COMMITMURDER AND SO ONWITH THE PRESENT COMPLEX FORMS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE IN EUROPECAN ANY EVENT THAT IS NOT PRESCRIBED DECREED OR ORDERED BY MONARCHSMINISTERS PARLIAMENTS OR NEWSPAPERS BE IMAGINED IS THERE ANYCOLLECTIVE ACTION WHICH CANNOT FIND ITS JUSTIFICATION IN POLITICALUNITY IN PATRIOTISM IN THE BALANCE OF POWER OR IN CIVILIZATION SOTHAT EVERY EVENT THAT OCCURS INEVITABLY COINCIDES WITH SOME EXPRESSEDWISH AND RECEIVING A JUSTIFICATION PRESENTS ITSELF AS THE RESULT OFTHE WILL OF ONE MAN OR OF SEVERAL MENIN WHATEVER DIRECTION A SHIP MOVES THE FLOW OF THE WAVES IT CUTSWILL ALWAYS BE NOTICEABLE AHEAD OF IT TO THOSE ON BOARD THE SHIP THEMOVEMENT OF THOSE WAVES WILL BE THE ONLY PERCEPTIBLE MOTIONONLY BY WATCHING CLOSELY MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF THAT FLOW ANDCOMPARING IT WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP DO WE CONVINCE OURSELVES THATEVERY BIT OF IT IS OCCASIONED BY THE FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE SHIPAND THAT WE WERE LED INTO ERROR BY THE FACT THAT WE OURSELVES WEREIMPERCEPTIBLY MOVINGWE SEE THE SAME IF WE WATCH MOMENT BY MOMENT THE MOVEMENT OF HISTORICALCHARACTERS THAT IS REESTABLISH THE INEVITABLE CONDITION OF ALL THATOCCURSTHE CONTINUITY OF MOVEMENT IN TIME AND DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THEESSENTIAL CONNECTION OF HISTORICAL PERSONS WITH THE MASSESWHEN THE SHIP MOVES IN ONE DIRECTION THERE IS ONE AND THE SAME WAVEAHEAD OF IT WHEN IT TURNS FREQUENTLY THE WAVE AHEAD OF IT ALSO TURNSFREQUENTLY BUT WHEREVER IT MAY TURN THERE ALWAYS WILL BE THE WAVEANTICIPATING ITS MOVEMENTWHATEVER HAPPENS IT ALWAYS APPEARS THAT JUST THAT EVENT WAS FORESEENAND DECREED WHEREVER THE SHIP MAY GO THE RUSH OF WATER WHICH NEITHERDIRECTS NOR INCREASES ITS MOVEMENT FOAMS AHEAD OF IT AND AT A DISTANCESEEMS TO US NOT MERELY TO MOVE OF ITSELF BUT TO GOVERN THE SHIPSMOVEMENT ALSOEXAMINING ONLY THOSE EXPRESSIONS OF THE WILL OF HISTORICAL PERSONSWHICH AS COMMANDS WERE RELATED TO EVENTS HISTORIANS HAVE ASSUMEDTHAT THE EVENTS DEPENDED ON THOSE COMMANDS BUT EXAMINING THE EVENTSTHEMSELVES AND THE CONNECTION IN WHICH THE HISTORICAL PERSONS STOOD TOTHE PEOPLE WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY AND THEIR ORDERS WERE DEPENDENT ONEVENTS THE INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF THIS DEDUCTION IS THAT HOWEVER MANYCOMMANDS WERE ISSUED THE EVENT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE UNLESS THERE AREOTHER CAUSES FOR IT BUT AS SOON AS AN EVENT OCCURSBE IT WHAT ITMAYTHEN OUT OF ALL THE CONTINUALLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF DIFFERENT PEOPLESOME WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND WHICH BY THEIR MEANING AND THEIR TIME OFUTTERANCE ARE RELATED AS COMMANDS TO THE EVENTSARRIVING AT THIS CONCLUSION WE CAN REPLY DIRECTLY AND POSITIVELY TOTHESE TWO ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS OF HISTORY WHAT IS POWER WHAT FORCE PRODUCES THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONS POWER IS THE RELATION OF A GIVEN PERSON TO OTHER INDIVIDUALSIN WHICH THE MORE THIS PERSON EXPRESSES OPINIONS PREDICTIONS ANDJUSTIFICATIONS OF THE COLLECTIVE ACTION THAT IS PERFORMED THE LESS ISHIS PARTICIPATION IN THAT ACTION THE MOVEMENT OF NATIONS IS CAUSED NOT BY POWER NOR BY INTELLECTUALACTIVITY NOR EVEN BY A COMBINATION OF THE TWO AS HISTORIANS HAVESUPPOSED BUT BY THE ACTIVITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE INTHE EVENTS AND WHO ALWAYS COMBINE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THOSE TAKINGTHE LARGEST DIRECT SHARE IN THE EVENT TAKE ON THEMSELVES THE LEASTRESPONSIBILITY AND VICE VERSAMORALLY THE WIELDER OF POWER APPEARS TO CAUSE THE EVENT PHYSICALLYIT IS THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO THE POWER BUT AS THE MORAL ACTIVITY ISINCONCEIVABLE WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT IS NEITHER INTHE ONE NOR IN THE OTHER BUT IN THE UNION OF THE TWOOR IN OTHER WORDS THE CONCEPTION OF A CAUSE IS INAPPLICABLE TO THEPHENOMENA WE ARE EXAMININGIN THE LAST ANALYSIS WE REACH THE CIRCLE OF INFINITYTHAT FINAL LIMITTO WHICH IN EVERY DOMAIN OF THOUGHT MANS REASON ARRIVES IF IT IS NOTPLAYING

THAT IT IS A LAWCHAPTER VIIIIF HISTORY DEALT ONLY WITH EXTERNAL PHENOMENA THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THISSIMPLE AND OBVIOUS LAW WOULD SUFFICE AND WE SHOULD HAVE FINISHED OURARGUMENT BUT THE LAW OF HISTORY RELATES TO MAN A PARTICLE OF MATTERCANNOT TELL US THAT IT DOES NOT FEEL THE LAW OF ATTRACTION OR REPULSIONAND THAT THAT LAW IS UNTRUE BUT MAN WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF HISTORYSAYS PLAINLY I AM FREE AND AM THEREFORE NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAWTHE PRESENCE OF THE PROBLEM OF MANS FREE WILL THOUGH UNEXPRESSED ISFELT AT EVERY STEP OF HISTORYALL SERIOUSLY THINKING HISTORIANS HAVE INVOLUNTARILY ENCOUNTERED THISQUESTION ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS AND OBSCURITIES OF HISTORY AND THEFALSE PATH HISTORICAL SCIENCE HAS FOLLOWED ARE DUE SOLELY TO THE LACK OFA SOLUTION OF THAT QUESTIONIF THE WILL OF EVERY MAN WERE FREE THAT IS IF EACH MAN COULD ACT AS HEPLEASED ALL HISTORY WOULD BE A SERIES OF DISCONNECTED INCIDENTSIF IN A THOUSAND YEARS EVEN ONE MAN IN A MILLION COULD ACT FREELY THATIS AS HE CHOSE IT IS EVIDENT THAT ONE SINGLE FREE ACT OF THAT MANSIN VIOLATION OF THE LAWS GOVERNING HUMAN ACTION WOULD DESTROY THEPOSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY LAWS FOR THE WHOLE OF HUMANITYIF THERE BE A SINGLE LAW GOVERNING THE ACTIONS OF MEN FREE WILL CANNOTEXIST FOR THEN MANS WILL IS SUBJECT TO THAT LAWIN THIS CONTRADICTION LIES THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL WHICH FROM MOSTANCIENT TIMES HAS OCCUPIED THE BEST HUMAN MINDS AND FROM MOST ANCIENTTIMES HAS BEEN PRESENTED IN ITS WHOLE TREMENDOUS SIGNIFICANCETHE PROBLEM IS THAT REGARDING MAN AS A SUBJECT OF OBSERVATIONFROM WHATEVER POINT OF VIEWTHEOLOGICAL HISTORICAL ETHICAL ORPHILOSOPHICWE FIND A GENERAL LAW OF NECESSITY TO WHICH HE LIKE ALLTHAT EXISTS IS SUBJECT BUT REGARDING HIM FROM WITHIN OURSELVES AS WHATWE ARE CONSCIOUS OF WE FEEL OURSELVES TO BE FREETHIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SOURCE OF SELFCOGNITION QUITE APART FROM ANDINDEPENDENT OF REASON THROUGH HIS REASON MAN OBSERVES HIMSELF BUT ONLYTHROUGH CONSCIOUSNESS DOES HE KNOW HIMSELFAPART FROM CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF NO OBSERVATION OR APPLICATION OF REASONIS CONCEIVABLETO UNDERSTAND OBSERVE AND DRAW CONCLUSIONS MAN MUST FIRST OF ALL BECONSCIOUS OF HIMSELF AS LIVING A MAN IS ONLY CONSCIOUS OF HIMSELF ASA

CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM WERE NOT A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENTSOURCE OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REASONING ANDTO EXPERIENCE BUT IN FACT SUCH SUBJECTION DOES NOT EXIST AND ISINCONCEIVABLEA SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND ARGUMENTS PROVES TO EVERY MAN THAT HE ASAN OBJECT OF OBSERVATION IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LAWS AND MAN SUBMITS TOTHEM AND NEVER RESISTS THE LAWS OF GRAVITY OR IMPERMEABILITY ONCE HEHAS BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEM BUT THE SAME SERIES OF EXPERIMENTSAND ARGUMENTS PROVES TO HIM THAT THE COMPLETE FREEDOM OF WHICH HE ISCONSCIOUS IN HIMSELF IS IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT

HOW SHOULD THE PAST LIFE OF NATIONS ANDOF HUMANITY BE REGARDEDAS THE RESULT OF THE FREE OR AS THE RESULT OFTHE CONSTRAINED ACTIVITY OF MAN THAT IS A QUESTION FOR HISTORYONLY IN OUR SELFCONFIDENT DAY OF THE POPULARIZATION OF KNOWLEDGETHANKSTO THAT MOST POWERFUL ENGINE OF IGNORANCE THE DIFFUSION OF PRINTEDMATTERHAS THE QUESTION OF THE FREEDOM OF WILL BEEN PUT ON A LEVEL ONWHICH THE QUESTION ITSELF CANNOT EXIST IN OUR TIME THE MAJORITY OFSOCALLED ADVANCED PEOPLETHAT IS THE CROWD OF IGNORAMUSESHAVE TAKENTHE WORK OF THE NATURALISTS WHO DEAL WITH ONE SIDE OF THE QUESTION FOR ASOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEMTHEY SAY AND WRITE AND PRINT THAT THE SOUL AND FREEDOM DO NOT EXISTFOR THE LIFE OF MAN IS EXPRESSED BY MUSCULAR MOVEMENTS AND MUSCULARMOVEMENTS ARE CONDITIONED BY THE ACTIVITY OF THE NERVES THE SOUL ANDFREE WILL DO NOT EXIST BECAUSE AT AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME WE SPRANGFROM THE APES THEY SAY THIS NOT AT ALL SUSPECTING THAT THOUSANDS OFYEARS AGO THAT SAME LAW OF NECESSITY WHICH WITH SUCH ARDOR THEY ARE NOWTRYING TO PROVE BY PHYSIOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY WAS NOT MERELYACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL THE RELIGIONS AND ALL THE THINKERS BUT HAS NEVERBEEN DENIED THEY DO NOT SEE THAT THE ROLE OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES INTHIS MATTER IS MERELY TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE ILLUMINATIONOF ONE SIDE OF IT FOR THE FACT THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OFOBSERVATION REASON AND THE WILL ARE MERELY SECRETIONS OF THE BRAIN ANDTHAT MAN FOLLOWING THE GENERAL LAW MAY HAVE DEVELOPED FROM LOWER ANIMALSAT SOME UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME ONLY EXPLAINS FROM A FRESH SIDETHE TRUTH ADMITTED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO BY ALL THE RELIGIOUS ANDPHILOSOPHIC THEORIESTHAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF REASON MAN ISSUBJECT TO THE LAW OF NECESSITY BUT IT DOES NOT ADVANCE BY A HAIRSBREADTH THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION WHICH HAS ANOTHER OPPOSITE SIDEBASED ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOMIF MEN DESCENDED FROM THE APES AT AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME THAT ISAS COMPREHENSIBLE AS THAT THEY WERE MADE FROM A HANDFUL OF EARTH AT ACERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME IN THE FIRST CASE THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY IS THETIME IN THE SECOND CASE IT IS THE ORIGIN AND THE QUESTION OF HOWMANS CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM IS TO BE RECONCILED WITH THE LAW OFNECESSITY TO WHICH HE IS SUBJECT CANNOT BE SOLVED BY COMPARATIVEPHYSIOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY FOR IN A FROG A RABBIT OR AN APE WE CANOBSERVE ONLY THE MUSCULAR NERVOUS ACTIVITY BUT IN MAN WE OBSERVECONSCIOUSNESS AS WELL AS THE MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS ACTIVITYTHE NATURALISTS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS THINKING THEY CAN SOLVE THISQUESTION ARE LIKE PLASTERERS SET TO PLASTER ONE SIDE OF THE WALLS OFA CHURCH WHO AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE ABSENCE OF THE CHIEFSUPERINTENDENT OF THE WORK SHOULD IN AN ACCESS OF ZEAL PLASTER OVER THEWINDOWS ICONS WOODWORK AND STILL UNBUTTRESSED WALLS AND SHOULD BEDELIGHTED THAT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW AS PLASTERERS EVERYTHING IS NOWSO SMOOTH AND REGULARCHAPTER IXFOR THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION OF FREE WILL OR INEVITABILITY HISTORYHAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH THEQUESTION IS DEALT WITH THAT FOR HISTORY THIS QUESTION DOES NOT REFERTO THE ESSENCE OF MANS FREE WILL BUT ITS MANIFESTATION IN THE PAST ANDUNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONSIN REGARD TO THIS QUESTION HISTORY STANDS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES ASEXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE STANDS TO ABSTRACT SCIENCETHE SUBJECT FOR HISTORY IS NOT MANS WILL ITSELF BUT OUR PRESENTATION OFITAND SO FOR HISTORY THE INSOLUBLE MYSTERY PRESENTED BY THEINCOMPATIBILITY OF FREE WILL AND INEVITABILITY DOES NOT EXIST AS IT DOESFOR THEOLOGY ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY HISTORY SURVEYS A PRESENTATION OFMANS LIFE IN WHICH THE UNION OF THESE TWO CONTRADICTIONS HAS ALREADYTAKEN PLACEIN ACTUAL LIFE EACH HISTORIC EVENT EACH HUMAN ACTION IS VERY CLEARLYAND DEFINITELY UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF CONTRADICTION ALTHOUGHEACH EVENT PRESENTS ITSELF AS PARTLY FREE AND PARTLY COMPULSORYTO SOLVE THE QUESTION OF HOW FREEDOM AND NECESSITY ARE COMBINED ANDWHAT CONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS THE PHILOSOPHYOF HISTORY CAN AND SHOULD FOLLOW A PATH CONTRARY TO THAT TAKEN BY OTHERSCIENCES INSTEAD OF FIRST DEFINING THE CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM ANDINEVITABILITY IN THEMSELVES AND THEN RANGING THE PHENOMENA OF LIFEUNDER THOSE DEFINITIONS HISTORY SHOULD DEDUCE A DEFINITION OF THECONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND INEVITABILITY THEMSELVES FROM THE IMMENSEQUANTITY OF PHENOMENA OF WHICH IT IS COGNIZANT AND THAT ALWAYS APPEARDEPENDENT ON THESE TWO ELEMENTSWHATEVER PRESENTATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF MANY MEN OR OF AN INDIVIDUALWE MAY CONSIDER WE ALWAYS REGARD IT AS THE RESULT PARTLY OF MANS FREEWILL AND PARTLY OF THE LAW OF INEVITABILITYWHETHER WE SPEAK OF THE MIGRATION OF THE PEOPLES AND THE INCURSIONSOF THE BARBARIANS OR OF THE DECREES OF NAPOLEON III OR OF SOMEONESACTION AN HOUR AGO IN CHOOSING ONE DIRECTION OUT OF SEVERAL FOR HISWALK WE ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY CONTRADICTION THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM ANDINEVITABILITY GOVERNING THE ACTIONS OF THESE PEOPLE IS CLEARLY DEFINEDFOR USOUR CONCEPTION OF THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM OFTEN VARIES ACCORDING TODIFFERENCES IN THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH WE REGARD THE EVENT BUTEVERY HUMAN ACTION APPEARS TO US AS A CERTAIN COMBINATION OF FREEDOM ANDINEVITABILITY IN EVERY ACTION WE EXAMINE WE SEE A CERTAIN MEASURE OFFREEDOM AND A CERTAIN MEASURE OF INEVITABILITY AND ALWAYS THE MOREFREEDOM WE SEE IN ANY ACTION THE LESS INEVITABILITY DO WE PERCEIVE ANDTHE MORE INEVITABILITY THE LESS FREEDOMTHE PROPORTION OF FREEDOM TO INEVITABILITY DECREASES AND INCREASESACCORDING TO THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH THE ACTION IS REGARDED BUTTHEIR RELATION IS ALWAYS ONE OF INVERSE PROPORTIONA SINKING MAN WHO CLUTCHES AT ANOTHER AND DROWNS HIM OR A HUNGRY MOTHEREXHAUSTED BY FEEDING HER BABY WHO STEALS SOME FOOD OR A MAN TRAINEDTO DISCIPLINE WHO ON DUTY AT THE WORD OF COMMAND KILLS A DEFENSELESSMANSEEM LESS GUILTY THAT IS LESS FREE AND MORE SUBJECT TO THE LAW OFNECESSITY TO ONE WHO KNOWS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE WEREPLACED AND MORE FREE TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE MAN WAS HIMSELFDROWNING THAT THE MOTHER WAS HUNGRY THAT THE SOLDIER WAS IN THE RANKSAND SO ON SIMILARLY A MAN WHO COMMITTED A MURDER TWENTY YEARS AGO ANDHAS SINCE LIVED PEACEABLY AND HARMLESSLY IN SOCIETY SEEMS LESS GUILTYAND HIS ACTION MORE DUE TO THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TO SOMEONE WHOCONSIDERS HIS ACTION AFTER TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED THAN TO ONE WHOEXAMINED IT THE DAY AFTER IT WAS COMMITTED AND IN THE SAME WAY EVERYACTION OF AN INSANE INTOXICATED OR HIGHLY EXCITED MAN APPEARS LESSFREE AND MORE INEVITABLE TO ONE WHO KNOWS THE MENTAL CONDITION OF HIMWHO COMMITTED THE ACTION AND SEEMS MORE FREE AND LESS INEVITABLE TO ONEWHO DOES NOT KNOW IT IN ALL THESE CASES THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOMIS INCREASED OR DIMINISHED AND THE CONCEPTION OF COMPULSION ISCORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED OR INCREASED ACCORDING TO THE POINT OF VIEWFROM WHICH THE ACTION IS REGARDED SO THAT THE GREATER THE CONCEPTION OFNECESSITY THE SMALLER THE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AND VICE VERSARELIGION THE COMMON SENSE OF MANKIND THE SCIENCE OF JURISPRUDENCEAND HISTORY ITSELF UNDERSTAND ALIKE THIS RELATION BETWEEN NECESSITY ANDFREEDOMALL CASES WITHOUT EXCEPTION IN WHICH OUR CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM ANDNECESSITY IS INCREASED AND DIMINISHED DEPEND ON THREE CONSIDERATIONS THE RELATION TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD OF THE MAN WHO COMMITS THE DEEDS HIS RELATION TO TIME HIS RELATION TO THE CAUSES LEADING TO THE ACTIONTHE FIRST CONSIDERATION IS THE CLEARNESS OF OUR PERCEPTION OF THE MANSRELATION TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND THE GREATER OR LESSER CLEARNESSOF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFINITE POSITION OCCUPIED BY THE MANIN RELATION TO EVERYTHING COEXISTING WITH HIM THIS IS WHAT MAKES ITEVIDENT THAT A DROWNING MAN IS LESS FREE AND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITYTHAN ONE STANDING ON DRY GROUND AND THAT MAKES THE ACTIONS OF A MANCLOSELY CONNECTED WITH OTHERS IN A THICKLY POPULATED DISTRICT OR OF ONEBOUND BY FAMILY OFFICIAL OR BUSINESS DUTIES SEEM CERTAINLY LESS FREEAND MORE SUBJECT TO NECESSITY THAN THOSE OF A MAN LIVING IN SOLITUDE ANDSECLUSIONIF WE CONSIDER A MAN ALONE APART FROM HIS RELATION TO EVERYTHING AROUNDHIM EACH ACTION OF HIS SEEMS TO US FREE BUT IF WE SEE HIS RELATIONTO ANYTHING AROUND HIM IF WE SEE HIS CONNECTION WITH ANYTHINGWHATEVERWITH A MAN WHO SPEAKS TO HIM A BOOK HE READS THE WORK ONWHICH HE IS ENGAGED EVEN WITH THE AIR HE BREATHES OR THE LIGHT THATFALLS ON THE THINGS ABOUT HIMWE SEE THAT EACH OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCESHAS AN INFLUENCE ON HIM AND CONTROLS AT LEAST SOME SIDE OF HIS ACTIVITYAND THE MORE WE PERCEIVE OF THESE INFLUENCES THE MORE OUR CONCEPTION OFHIS FREEDOM DIMINISHES AND THE MORE OUR CONCEPTION OF THE NECESSITY THATWEIGHS ON HIM INCREASESTHE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS THE MORE OR LESS EVIDENT TIME RELATION OFTHE MAN TO THE WORLD AND THE CLEARNESS OF OUR PERCEPTION OF THE PLACETHE MANS ACTION OCCUPIES IN TIME THAT IS THE GROUND WHICH MAKES THEFALL OF THE FIRST MAN RESULTING IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RACEAPPEAR EVIDENTLY LESS FREE THAN A MANS ENTRY INTO MARRIAGE TODAY IT ISTHE REASON WHY THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED CENTURIES AGOAND ARE CONNECTED WITH ME IN TIME CANNOT SEEM TO ME AS FREE AS THE LIFEOF A CONTEMPORARY THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN TO METHE DEGREE OF OUR CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM OR INEVITABILITY DEPENDS IN THISRESPECT ON THE GREATER OR LESSER LAPSE OF TIME BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCEOF THE ACTION AND OUR JUDGMENT OF ITIF I EXAMINE AN ACT I PERFORMED A MOMENT AGO IN APPROXIMATELY THE SAMECIRCUMSTANCES AS THOSE I AM IN NOW MY ACTION APPEARS TO ME UNDOUBTEDLYFREE BUT IF I EXAMINE AN ACT PERFORMED A MONTH AGO THEN BEING INDIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES I CANNOT HELP RECOGNIZING THAT IF THAT ACT HADNOT BEEN COMMITTED MUCH THAT RESULTED FROM ITGOOD AGREEABLE AND EVENESSENTIALWOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IF I REFLECT ON AN ACTION STILLMORE REMOTE TEN YEARS AGO OR MORE THEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONARE STILL PLAINER TO ME AND I FIND IT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED HAD THAT ACTION NOT BEEN PERFORMED THE FARTHER I GO BACKIN MEMORY OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING THE FARTHER I GO FORWARD IN MYJUDGMENT THE MORE DOUBTFUL BECOMES MY BELIEF IN THE FREEDOM OF MYACTIONIN HISTORY WE FIND A VERY SIMILAR PROGRESS OF CONVICTION CONCERNINGTHE PART PLAYED BY FREE WILL IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF HUMANITY ACONTEMPORARY EVENT SEEMS TO US TO BE INDUBITABLY THE DOING OF ALL THEKNOWN PARTICIPANTS BUT WITH A MORE REMOTE EVENT WE ALREADY SEE ITSINEVITABLE RESULTS WHICH PREVENT OUR CONSIDERING ANYTHING ELSE POSSIBLEAND THE FARTHER WE GO BACK IN EXAMINING EVENTS THE LESS ARBITRARY DOTHEY APPEARTHE AUSTROPRUSSIAN WAR APPEARS TO US UNDOUBTEDLY THE RESULT OF THECRAFTY CONDUCT OF BISMARCK AND SO ON THE NAPOLEONIC WARS STILL SEEMTO US THOUGH ALREADY QUESTIONABLY TO BE THE OUTCOME OF THEIR HEROESWILL BUT IN THE CRUSADES WE ALREADY SEE AN EVENT OCCUPYING ITS DEFINITEPLACE IN HISTORY AND WITHOUT WHICH WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE MODERN HISTORYOF EUROPE THOUGH TO THE CHRONICLERS OF THE CRUSADES THAT EVENT APPEAREDAS MERELY DUE TO THE WILL OF CERTAIN PEOPLE IN REGARD TO THE MIGRATIONOF THE PEOPLES IT DOES NOT ENTER ANYONES HEAD TODAY TO SUPPOSE THATTHE RENOVATION OF THE EUROPEAN WORLD DEPENDED ON ATTILAS CAPRICE THEFARTHER BACK IN HISTORY THE OBJECT OF OUR OBSERVATION LIES THE MOREDOUBTFUL DOES THE FREE WILL OF THOSE CONCERNED IN THE EVENT BECOME ANDTHE MORE MANIFEST THE LAW OF INEVITABILITYTHE THIRD CONSIDERATION IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE APPREHEND THATENDLESS CHAIN OF CAUSATION INEVITABLY DEMANDED BY REASON IN WHICH EACHPHENOMENON COMPREHENDED AND THEREFORE MANS EVERY ACTION MUST HAVEITS DEFINITE PLACE AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE AND AS A CAUSE OFWHAT WILL FOLLOWTHE BETTER WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ANDHISTORICAL LAWS DEDUCED BY OBSERVATION AND BY WHICH MAN IS CONTROLLEDAND THE MORE CORRECTLY WE PERCEIVE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICALAND HISTORICAL CAUSES OF THE ACTION AND THE SIMPLER THE ACTION WE AREOBSERVING AND THE LESS COMPLEX THE CHARACTER AND MIND OF THE MAN INQUESTION THE MORE SUBJECT TO INEVITABILITY AND THE LESS FREE DO OURACTIONS AND THOSE OF OTHERS APPEARWHEN WE DO NOT AT ALL UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE OF AN ACTION WHETHER ACRIME A GOOD ACTION OR EVEN ONE THAT IS SIMPLY NONMORAL WE ASCRIBE AGREATER AMOUNT OF FREEDOM TO IT IN THE CASE OF A CRIME WE MOST URGENTLYDEMAND THE PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH AN ACT IN THE CASE OF A VIRTUOUS ACT WERATE ITS MERIT MOST HIGHLY IN AN INDIFFERENT CASE WE RECOGNIZE IN ITMORE INDIVIDUALITY ORIGINALITY AND INDEPENDENCE BUT IF EVEN ONE OFTHE INNUMERABLE CAUSES OF THE ACT IS KNOWN TO US WE RECOGNIZE A CERTAINELEMENT OF NECESSITY AND ARE LESS INSISTENT ON PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIMEOR THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE MERIT OF THE VIRTUOUS ACT OR THE FREEDOMOF THE APPARENTLY ORIGINAL ACTION THAT A CRIMINAL WAS REARED AMONGMALEFACTORS MITIGATES HIS FAULT IN OUR EYES THE SELFSACRIFICE OF A FATHEROR MOTHER OR SELFSACRIFICE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A REWARD IS MORECOMPREHENSIBLE THAN GRATUITOUS SELFSACRIFICE AND THEREFORE SEEMS LESSDESERVING OF SYMPATHY AND LESS THE RESULT OF FREE WILL THE FOUNDER OF ASECT OR PARTY OR AN INVENTOR IMPRESSES US LESS WHEN WE KNOW HOW OR BYWHAT THE WAY WAS PREPARED FOR HIS ACTIVITY IF WE HAVE A LARGE RANGEOF EXAMPLES IF OUR OBSERVATION IS CONSTANTLY DIRECTED TO SEEKING THECORRELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IN PEOPLES ACTIONS THEIR ACTIONSAPPEAR TO US MORE UNDER COMPULSION AND LESS FREE THE MORE CORRECTLY WECONNECT THE EFFECTS WITH THE CAUSES IF WE EXAMINED SIMPLE ACTIONS ANDHAD A VAST NUMBER OF SUCH ACTIONS UNDER OBSERVATION OUR CONCEPTION OFTHEIR INEVITABILITY WOULD BE STILL GREATER THE DISHONEST CONDUCT OF THESON OF A DISHONEST FATHER THE MISCONDUCT OF A WOMAN WHO HAD FALLENINTO BAD COMPANY A DRUNKARDS RELAPSE INTO DRUNKENNESS AND SO ON AREACTIONS THAT SEEM TO US LESS FREE THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THEIR CAUSEIF THE MAN WHOSE ACTIONS WE ARE CONSIDERING IS ON A VERY LOW STAGE OFMENTAL DEVELOPMENT LIKE A CHILD A MADMAN OR A SIMPLETONTHENKNOWING THE CAUSES OF THE ACT AND THE SIMPLICITY OF THE CHARACTER ANDINTELLIGENCE IN QUESTION WE SEE SO LARGE AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY AND SOLITTLE FREE WILL THAT AS SOON AS WE KNOW THE CAUSE PROMPTING THE ACTIONWE CAN FORETELL THE RESULTON THESE THREE CONSIDERATIONS ALONE IS BASED THE CONCEPTION OFIRRESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIMES AND THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ADMITTEDBY ALL LEGISLATIVE CODES THE RESPONSIBILITY APPEARS GREATER OR LESSACCORDING TO OUR GREATER OR LESSER KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES INWHICH THE MAN WAS PLACED WHOSE ACTION IS BEING JUDGED AND ACCORDINGTO THE GREATER OR LESSER INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN THE COMMISSION OF THEACTION AND ITS INVESTIGATION AND ACCORDING TO THE GREATER OR LESSERUNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES THAT LED TO THE ACTIONCHAPTER XTHUS OUR CONCEPTION OF FREE WILL AND INEVITABILITY GRADUALLY DIMINISHESOR INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE GREATER OR LESSER CONNECTION WITH THEEXTERNAL WORLD THE GREATER OR LESSER REMOTENESS OF TIME AND THEGREATER OR LESSER DEPENDENCE ON THE CAUSES IN RELATION TO WHICH WECONTEMPLATE A MANS LIFESO THAT IF WE EXAMINE THE CASE OF A MAN WHOSE CONNECTION WITH THEEXTERNAL WORLD IS WELL KNOWN WHERE THE TIME BETWEEN THE ACTION ANDITS EXAMINATION IS GREAT AND WHERE THE CAUSES OF THE ACTION ARE MOSTACCESSIBLE WE GET THE CONCEPTION OF A MAXIMUM OF INEVITABILITY AND AMINIMUM OF FREE WILL IF WE EXAMINE A MAN LITTLE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNALCONDITIONS WHOSE ACTION WAS PERFORMED VERY RECENTLY AND THE CAUSES OFWHOSE ACTION ARE BEYOND OUR KEN WE GET THE CONCEPTION OF A MINIMUM OFINEVITABILITY AND A MAXIMUM OF FREEDOMIN NEITHER CASEHOWEVER WE MAY CHANGE OUR POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER PLAINWE MAY MAKE TO OURSELVES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE EXTERNALWORLD HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE IT MAY BE TO US HOWEVER LONG OR SHORT THEPERIOD OF TIME HOWEVER INTELLIGIBLE OR INCOMPREHENSIBLE THE CAUSESOF THE ACTION MAY BECAN WE EVER CONCEIVE EITHER COMPLETE FREEDOM ORCOMPLETE NECESSITY TO WHATEVER DEGREE WE MAY IMAGINE A MAN TO BE EXEMPT FROM THEINFLUENCE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE NEVER GET A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOMIN SPACE EVERY HUMAN ACTION IS INEVITABLY CONDITIONED BY WHAT SURROUNDSHIM AND BY HIS OWN BODY I LIFT MY ARM AND LET IT FALL MY ACTION SEEMSTO ME FREE BUT ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I COULD RAISE MY ARM IN EVERYDIRECTION I SEE THAT I RAISED IT IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THERE WASLEAST OBSTRUCTION TO THAT ACTION EITHER FROM THINGS AROUND ME OR FROMTHE CONSTRUCTION OF MY OWN BODY I CHOSE ONE OUT OF ALL THE POSSIBLEDIRECTIONS BECAUSE IN IT THERE WERE FEWEST OBSTACLES FOR MY ACTIONTO BE FREE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD ENCOUNTER NO OBSTACLES TOCONCEIVE OF A MAN BEING FREE WE MUST IMAGINE HIM OUTSIDE SPACE WHICH ISEVIDENTLY IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER MUCH WE APPROXIMATE THE TIME OF JUDGMENT TO THE TIME OF THEDEED WE NEVER GET A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM IN TIME FOR IF I EXAMINEAN ACTION COMMITTED A SECOND AGO I MUST STILL RECOGNIZE IT AS NOTBEING FREE FOR IT IS IRREVOCABLY LINKED TO THE MOMENT AT WHICH IT WASCOMMITTED CAN I LIFT MY ARM I LIFT IT BUT ASK MYSELF COULD I HAVEABSTAINED FROM LIFTING MY ARM AT THE MOMENT THAT HAS ALREADY PASSED TOCONVINCE MYSELF OF THIS I DO NOT LIFT IT THE NEXT MOMENT BUT I AMNOT NOW ABSTAINING FROM DOING SO AT THE FIRST MOMENT WHEN I ASKED THEQUESTION TIME HAS GONE BY WHICH I COULD NOT DETAIN THE ARM I THENLIFTED IS NO LONGER THE SAME AS THE ARM I NOW REFRAIN FROM LIFTINGNOR IS THE AIR IN WHICH I LIFTED IT THE SAME THAT NOW SURROUNDS ME THEMOMENT IN WHICH THE FIRST MOVEMENT WAS MADE IS IRREVOCABLE AND AT THATMOMENT I COULD MAKE ONLY ONE MOVEMENT AND WHATEVER MOVEMENT I MADEWOULD BE THE ONLY ONE THAT I DID NOT LIFT MY ARM A MOMENT LATER DOESNOT PROVE THAT I COULD HAVE ABSTAINED FROM LIFTING IT THEN AND SINCE ICOULD MAKE ONLY ONE MOVEMENT AT THAT SINGLE MOMENT OF TIME IT COULD NOTHAVE BEEN ANY OTHER TO IMAGINE IT AS FREE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMAGINEIT IN THE PRESENT ON THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURETHATIS OUTSIDE TIME WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER MUCH THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES MAY BEINCREASED WE NEVER REACH A CONCEPTION OF COMPLETE FREEDOM THAT ISAN ABSENCE OF CAUSE HOWEVER INACCESSIBLE TO US MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THEEXPRESSION OF WILL IN ANY ACTION OUR OWN OR ANOTHERS THE FIRST DEMANDOF REASON IS THE ASSUMPTION OF AND SEARCH FOR A CAUSE FOR WITHOUT ACAUSE NO PHENOMENON IS CONCEIVABLE I RAISE MY ARM TO PERFORM AN ACTIONINDEPENDENTLY OF ANY CAUSE BUT MY WISH TO PERFORM AN ACTION WITHOUT ACAUSE IS THE CAUSE OF MY ACTIONBUT EVEN IFIMAGINING A MAN QUITE EXEMPT FROM ALL INFLUENCES EXAMININGONLY HIS MOMENTARY ACTION IN THE PRESENT UNEVOKED BY ANY CAUSEWE WERETO ADMIT SO INFINITELY SMALL A REMAINDER OF INEVITABILITY AS EQUALEDZERO WE SHOULD EVEN THEN NOT HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONCEPTION OF COMPLETEFREEDOM IN MAN FOR A BEING UNINFLUENCED BY THE EXTERNAL WORLD STANDINGOUTSIDE OF TIME AND INDEPENDENT OF CAUSE IS NO LONGER A MANIN THE SAME WAY WE CAN NEVER IMAGINE THE ACTION OF A MAN QUITE DEVOID OFFREEDOM AND ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY HOWEVER WE MAY INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS OF SPACEIN WHICH MAN IS SITUATED THAT KNOWLEDGE CAN NEVER BE COMPLETE FOR THENUMBER OF THOSE CONDITIONS IS AS INFINITE AS THE INFINITY OF SPACE ANDTHEREFORE SO LONG AS NOT ALL THE CONDITIONS INFLUENCING MEN ARE DEFINEDTHERE IS NO COMPLETE INEVITABILITY BUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF FREEDOMREMAINS HOWEVER WE MAY PROLONG THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE ACTION WE AREEXAMINING AND THE JUDGMENT UPON IT THAT PERIOD WILL BE FINITE WHILETIME IS INFINITE AND SO IN THIS RESPECT TOO THERE CAN NEVER BE ABSOLUTEINEVITABILITY HOWEVER ACCESSIBLE MAY BE THE CHAIN OF CAUSATION OF ANY ACTION WESHALL NEVER KNOW THE WHOLE CHAIN SINCE IT IS ENDLESS AND SO AGAIN WENEVER REACH ABSOLUTE INEVITABILITYBUT BESIDES THIS EVEN IF ADMITTING THE REMAINING MINIMUM OF FREEDOM TOEQUAL ZERO WE ASSUMED IN SOME GIVEN CASEAS FOR INSTANCE IN THAT OF ADYING MAN AN UNBORN BABE OR AN IDIOTCOMPLETE ABSENCE OF FREEDOM BYSO DOING WE SHOULD DESTROY THE VERY CONCEPTION OF MAN IN THE CASE WE AREEXAMINING FOR AS SOON AS THERE IS NO FREEDOM THERE IS ALSO NO MAN ANDSO THE CONCEPTION OF THE ACTION OF A MAN SUBJECT SOLELY TO THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY WITHOUT ANY ELEMENT OF FREEDOM IS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE ASTHE CONCEPTION OF A MANS COMPLETELY FREE ACTIONAND SO TO IMAGINE THE ACTION OF A MAN ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY WITHOUT ANY FREEDOM WE MUST ASSUME THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANINFINITE NUMBER OF SPACE RELATIONS AN INFINITELY LONG PERIOD OF TIMEAND AN INFINITE SERIES OF CAUSESTO IMAGINE A MAN PERFECTLY FREE AND NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY WE MUST IMAGINE HIM ALL ALONE BEYOND SPACE BEYOND TIMEAND FREE FROM DEPENDENCE ON CAUSEIN THE FIRST CASE IF INEVITABILITY WERE POSSIBLE WITHOUT FREEDOMWE SHOULD HAVE REACHED A DEFINITION OF INEVITABILITY BY THE LAWS OFINEVITABILITY ITSELF THAT IS A MERE FORM WITHOUT CONTENTIN THE SECOND CASE IF FREEDOM WERE POSSIBLE WITHOUT INEVITABILITY WESHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AT UNCONDITIONED FREEDOM BEYOND SPACE TIME ANDCAUSE WHICH BY THE FACT OF ITS BEING UNCONDITIONED AND UNLIMITED WOULDBE NOTHING OR MERE CONTENT WITHOUT FORMWE SHOULD IN FACT HAVE REACHED THOSE TWO FUNDAMENTALS OF WHICH MANSWHOLE OUTLOOK ON THE UNIVERSE IS CONSTRUCTEDTHE INCOMPREHENSIBLEESSENCE OF LIFE AND THE LAWS DEFINING THAT ESSENCEREASON SAYS  SPACE WITH ALL THE FORMS OF MATTER THAT GIVE ITVISIBILITY IS INFINITE AND CANNOT BE IMAGINED OTHERWISE  TIME ISINFINITE MOTION WITHOUT A MOMENT OF REST AND IS UNTHINKABLE OTHERWISE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT HAS NO BEGINNING AND CANHAVE NO ENDCONSCIOUSNESS SAYS  I ALONE AM AND ALL THAT EXISTS IS BUT MECONSEQUENTLY I INCLUDE SPACE  I MEASURE FLOWING TIME BY THE FIXEDMOMENT OF THE PRESENT IN WHICH ALONE I AM CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF AS LIVINGCONSEQUENTLY I AM OUTSIDE TIME  I AM BEYOND CAUSE FOR I FEEL MYSELFTO BE THE CAUSE OF EVERY MANIFESTATION OF MY LIFEREASON GIVES EXPRESSION TO THE LAWS OF INEVITABILITY CONSCIOUSNESSGIVES EXPRESSION TO THE ESSENCE OF FREEDOMFREEDOM NOT LIMITED BY ANYTHING IS THE ESSENCE OF LIFE IN MANSCONSCIOUSNESS INEVITABILITY WITHOUT CONTENT IS MANS REASON IN ITSTHREE FORMSFREEDOM IS THE THING EXAMINED INEVITABILITY IS WHAT EXAMINES FREEDOMIS THE CONTENT INEVITABILITY IS THE FORMONLY BY SEPARATING THE TWO SOURCES OF COGNITION RELATED TO ONE ANOTHERAS FORM TO CONTENT DO WE GET THE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND SEPARATELYINCOMPREHENSIBLE CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM AND INEVITABILITYONLY BY UNITING THEM DO WE GET A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MANS LIFEAPART FROM THESE TWO CONCEPTS WHICH IN THEIR UNION MUTUALLY DEFINE ONEANOTHER AS FORM AND CONTENT NO CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS POSSIBLEALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE LIFE OF MAN IS MERELY A CERTAIN RELATION OF FREEWILL TO INEVITABILITY THAT IS OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE LAWS OF REASONALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD OF NATURE IS ONLY A CERTAINRELATION OF THE FORCES OF NATURE TO INEVITABILITY OR OF THE ESSENCE OFLIFE TO THE LAWS OF REASONTHE GREAT NATURAL FORCES LIE OUTSIDE US AND WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OFTHEM WE CALL THOSE FORCES GRAVITATION INERTIA ELECTRICITY ANIMALFORCE AND SO ON BUT WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE FORCE OF LIFE IN MAN ANDWE CALL THAT FREEDOMBUT JUST AS THE FORCE OF GRAVITATION INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN ITSELF BUTFELT BY EVERY MAN IS UNDERSTOOD BY US ONLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WEKNOW THE LAWS OF INEVITABILITY TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT FROM THE FIRSTKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL BODIES HAVE WEIGHT UP TO NEWTONS LAW SO TOO THEFORCE OF FREE WILL INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN ITSELF BUT OF WHICH EVERYONE ISCONSCIOUS IS INTELLIGIBLE TO US ONLY IN AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE LAWS OFINEVITABILITY TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT FROM THE FACT THAT EVERY MAN DIESUP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST COMPLEX ECONOMIC AND HISTORIC LAWSALL KNOWLEDGE IS MERELY A BRINGING OF THIS ESSENCE OF LIFE UNDER THELAWS OF REASONMANS FREE WILL DIFFERS FROM EVERY OTHER FORCE IN THAT MAN IS DIRECTLYCONSCIOUS OF IT BUT IN THE EYES OF REASON IT IN NO WAY DIFFERS FROMANY OTHER FORCE THE FORCES OF GRAVITATION ELECTRICITY OR CHEMICALAFFINITY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER IN THAT THEY AREDIFFERENTLY DEFINED BY REASON JUST SO THE FORCE OF MANS FREE WILLIS DISTINGUISHED BY REASON FROM THE OTHER FORCES OF NATURE ONLY BY THEDEFINITION REASON GIVES IT FREEDOM APART FROM NECESSITY THAT ISAPART FROM THE LAWS OF REASON THAT DEFINE IT DIFFERS IN NO WAY FROMGRAVITATION OR HEAT OR THE FORCE THAT MAKES THINGS GROW FOR REASONIT IS ONLY A MOMENTARY UNDEFINABLE SENSATION OF LIFEAND AS THE UNDEFINABLE ESSENCE OF THE FORCE MOVING THE HEAVENLY BODIESTHE UNDEFINABLE ESSENCE OF THE FORCES OF HEAT AND ELECTRICITY OROF CHEMICAL AFFINITY OR OF THE VITAL FORCE FORMS THE CONTENT OFASTRONOMY PHYSICS CHEMISTRY BOTANY ZOOLOGY AND SO ON JUST IN THESAME WAY DOES THE FORCE OF FREE WILL FORM THE CONTENT OF HISTORYBUT JUST AS THE SUBJECT OF EVERY SCIENCE IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THISUNKNOWN ESSENCE OF LIFE WHILE THAT ESSENCE ITSELF CAN ONLY BE THESUBJECT OF METAPHYSICS EVEN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FORCE OF FREE WILLIN HUMAN BEINGS IN SPACE IN TIME AND IN DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE FORMSTHE SUBJECT OF HISTORY WHILE FREE WILL ITSELF IS THE SUBJECT OFMETAPHYSICSIN THE EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCES WHAT WE KNOW WE CALL THE LAWS OFINEVITABILITY WHAT IS UNKNOWN TO US WE CALL VITAL FORCE VITAL FORCE ISONLY AN EXPRESSION FOR THE UNKNOWN REMAINDER OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WE KNOWOF THE ESSENCE OF LIFESO ALSO IN HISTORY WHAT IS KNOWN TO US WE CALL LAWS OF INEVITABILITYWHAT IS UNKNOWN WE CALL FREE WILL FREE WILL IS FOR HISTORY ONLY ANEXPRESSION FOR THE UNKNOWN REMAINDER OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE LAWS OFHUMAN LIFECHAPTER XIHISTORY EXAMINES THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MANS FREE WILL IN CONNECTIONWITH THE EXTERNAL WORLD IN TIME AND IN DEPENDENCE ON CAUSE THAT IS ITDEFINES THIS FREEDOM BY THE LAWS OF REASON AND SO HISTORY IS A SCIENCEONLY IN SO FAR AS THIS FREE WILL IS DEFINED BY THOSE LAWSTHE RECOGNITION OF MANS FREE WILL AS SOMETHING CAPABLE OF INFLUENCINGHISTORICAL EVENTS THAT IS AS NOT SUBJECT TO LAWS IS THE SAME FORHISTORY AS THE RECOGNITION OF A FREE FORCE MOVING THE HEAVENLY BODIESWOULD BE FOR ASTRONOMYTHAT ASSUMPTION WOULD DESTROY THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF LAWSTHAT IS OF ANY SCIENCE WHATEVER IF THERE IS EVEN A SINGLE BODYMOVING FREELY THEN THE LAWS OF KEPLER AND NEWTON ARE NEGATIVED AND NOCONCEPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES ANY LONGER EXISTS IFANY SINGLE ACTION IS DUE TO FREE WILL THEN NOT A SINGLE HISTORICAL LAWCAN EXIST NOR ANY CONCEPTION OF HISTORICAL EVENTSFOR HISTORY LINES EXIST OF THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN WILLS ONE ENDOF WHICH IS HIDDEN IN THE UNKNOWN BUT AT THE OTHER END OF WHICH ACONSCIOUSNESS OF MANS WILL IN THE PRESENT MOVES IN SPACE TIME ANDDEPENDENCE ON CAUSETHE MORE THIS FIELD OF MOTION SPREADS OUT BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOREEVIDENT ARE THE LAWS OF THAT MOVEMENT TO DISCOVER AND DEFINE THOSE LAWSIS THE PROBLEM OF HISTORYFROM THE STANDPOINT FROM WHICH THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY NOW REGARDS ITSSUBJECT ON THE PATH IT NOW FOLLOWS SEEKING THE CAUSES OF EVENTS INMANS FREE WILL A SCIENTIFIC ENUNCIATION OF THOSE LAWS IS IMPOSSIBLEFOR HOWEVER MANS FREE WILL MAY BE RESTRICTED AS SOON AS WE RECOGNIZEIT AS A FORCE NOT SUBJECT TO LAW THE EXISTENCE OF LAW BECOMESIMPOSSIBLEONLY BY REDUCING THIS ELEMENT OF FREE WILL TO THE INFINITESIMAL THATIS BY REGARDING IT AS AN INFINITELY SMALL QUANTITY CAN WE CONVINCEOURSELVES OF THE ABSOLUTE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE CAUSES AND THENINSTEAD OF SEEKING CAUSES HISTORY WILL TAKE THE DISCOVERY OF LAWS ASITS PROBLEMTHE SEARCH FOR THESE LAWS HAS LONG BEEN BEGUN AND THE NEW METHODS OFTHOUGHT WHICH HISTORY MUST ADOPT ARE BEING WORKED OUT SIMULTANEOUSLYWITH THE SELFDESTRUCTION TOWARD WHICHEVER DISSECTING AND DISSECTINGTHE CAUSES OF PHENOMENATHE OLD METHOD OF HISTORY IS MOVINGALL HUMAN SCIENCES HAVE TRAVELED ALONG THAT PATH ARRIVING ATINFINITESIMALS MATHEMATICS THE MOST EXACT OF SCIENCES ABANDONS THEPROCESS OF ANALYSIS AND ENTERS ON THE NEW PROCESS OF THE INTEGRATIONOF UNKNOWN INFINITELY SMALL QUANTITIES ABANDONING THE CONCEPTIONOF CAUSE MATHEMATICS SEEKS LAW THAT IS THE PROPERTY COMMON TO ALLUNKNOWN INFINITELY SMALL ELEMENTSIN ANOTHER FORM BUT ALONG THE SAME PATH OF REFLECTION THE OTHER SCIENCESHAVE PROCEEDED WHEN NEWTON ENUNCIATED THE LAW OF GRAVITY HE DID NOT SAYTHAT THE SUN OR THE EARTH HAD A PROPERTY OF ATTRACTION HE SAID THAT ALLBODIES FROM THE LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST HAVE THE PROPERTY OF ATTRACTINGONE ANOTHER THAT IS LEAVING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF THE CAUSE OF THEMOVEMENT OF THE BODIES HE EXPRESSED THE PROPERTY COMMON TO ALL BODIESFROM THE INFINITELY LARGE TO THE INFINITELY SMALL THE SAME IS DONE BYTHE NATURAL SCIENCES LEAVING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF CAUSE THEY SEEK FORLAWS HISTORY STANDS ON THE SAME PATH AND IF HISTORY HAS FOR ITS OBJECTTHE STUDY OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE NATIONS AND OF HUMANITY AND NOT THENARRATION OF EPISODES IN THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS IT TOO SETTINGASIDE THE CONCEPTION OF CAUSE SHOULD SEEK THE LAWS COMMON TO ALL THEINSEPARABLY INTERCONNECTED INFINITESIMAL ELEMENTS OF FREE WILLCHAPTER XIIFROM THE TIME THE LAW OF COPERNICUS WAS DISCOVERED AND PROVED THE MERERECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT THE SUN BUT THE EARTH THAT MOVESSUFFICED TO DESTROY THE WHOLE COSMOGRAPHY OF THE ANCIENTS BY DISPROVINGTHAT LAW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETAIN THE OLD CONCEPTION OFTHE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODIES BUT WITHOUT DISPROVING IT IT WOULD SEEMIMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS BUT EVEN AFTERTHE DISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS WERE STILLSTUDIED FOR A LONG TIMEFROM THE TIME THE FIRST PERSON SAID AND PROVED THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHSOR OF CRIMES IS SUBJECT TO MATHEMATICAL LAWS AND THAT THIS OR THATMODE OF GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMICCONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCEMIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILTWERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCEBY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEENRETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUESTUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MANS FREE WILL FOR IF ACERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONSOF PEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHICETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THEN THE FREE WILL OF THOSEINDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT MODE OF GOVERNMENTOR OCCASIONED THE MIGRATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSEAND YET THE FORMER HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THELAWS OF STATISTICS GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL ECONOMY COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGYAND GEOLOGY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICT ITS ASSUMPTIONSTHE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OLD VIEWS AND THE NEW WAS LONG AND STUBBORNLYFOUGHT OUT IN PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THEOLOGY STOOD ON GUARD FOR THEOLD VIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION BUT WHEN TRUTHCONQUERED THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEWFOUNDATIONJUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEENTHE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAYSTANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF SUBVERTINGREVELATIONIN THE ONE CASE AS IN THE OTHER ON BOTH SIDES THE STRUGGLE PROVOKESPASSION AND STIFLES TRUTH ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS FEAR AND REGRET FORTHE LOSS OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE AGES ON THE OTHERIS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTIONTO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHYIT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH INGOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT AND IN THE MIRACLE OF JOSHUA THESON OF NUN TO THE DEFENDERS OF THE LAWS OF COPERNICUS AND NEWTON TOVOLTAIRE FOR EXAMPLE IT SEEMED THAT THE LAWS OF ASTRONOMY DESTROYEDRELIGION AND HE UTILIZED THE LAW OF GRAVITATION AS A WEAPON AGAINSTRELIGIONJUST SO IT NOW SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE ONLY TO ADMIT THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY TO DESTROY THE CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL OF GOOD AND EVILAND ALL THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AND CHURCH THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT UP ONTHOSE CONCEPTIONSSO TOO LIKE VOLTAIRE IN HIS TIME UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OFINEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION THOUGHTHE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS INASTRONOMY FAR FROM DESTROYING EVEN STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICHTHE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AND CHURCH ARE ERECTEDAS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORYNOW THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION ORNONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLEPHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY IT WAS THE IMMOVABILITY OF THE EARTH IN HISTORYIT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITYFREE WILLAS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTHLAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTHS FIXITY AND OFTHE MOTION OF THE PLANETS SO IN HISTORY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZINGTHE SUBJECTION OF PERSONALITY TO THE LAWS OF SPACE TIME AND CAUSELIES IN RENOUNCING THE DIRECT FEELING OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF ONES OWNPERSONALITY BUT AS IN ASTRONOMY THE NEW VIEW SAID IT IS TRUE THAT WEDO NOT FEEL THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH BUT BY ADMITTING ITS IMMOBILITYWE ARRIVE AT ABSURDITY WHILE BY ADMITTING ITS MOTION WHICH WE DO NOTFEEL WE ARRIVE AT LAWS SO ALSO IN HISTORY THE NEW VIEW SAYS IT ISTRUE THAT WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF OUR DEPENDENCE BUT BY ADMITTING OURFREE WILL WE ARRIVE AT ABSURDITY WHILE BY ADMITTING OUR DEPENDENCE ONTHE EXTERNAL WORLD ON TIME AND ON CAUSE WE ARRIVE AT LAWSIN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANUNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEELIN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE A FREEDOMTHAT DOES NOT EXIST AND TO RECOGNIZE A DEPENDENCE OF WHICH WE ARE NOTCONSCIOUS
